        "question": "How does the distance to the water table (DWT) differentially influence the α-diversity trends of DNA and RNA viral communities in the Dajiuhu peatland, and what are the potential ecological implications of these contrasting trends for methane cycling?",
        "answer": "**Question 1: How does the distance to the water table (DWT) differentially influence the α-diversity trends of DNA and RNA viral communities in the Dajiuhu peatland, and what are the potential ecological implications of these contrasting trends for methane cycling?**\n\n**Step 1: Extract relevant data on α-diversity trends and DWT relationship**  \nThe context reveals contrasting α-diversity trends for DNA and RNA viruses with increasing DWT (Fig. 1B). DNA viral α-diversity (Shannon index) peaks at intermediate DWT (15–20 cm), declining slightly at higher DWT (45–50 cm), while RNA viral α-diversity decreases monotonically with DWT. Statistical significance is noted for DNA viruses at 15–20 cm (*p* < 0.001) compared to shallower layers.  \n\n**Step 2: Analyze environmental mediators of these trends**  \nDWT indirectly influences DNA viral diversity via redox potential (Eh; coefficient = −0.99 in PLS-PM analysis, Fig. 3B), where higher DWT correlates with lower Eh (Fig. 3A), creating more anoxic conditions. RNA viral diversity is directly reduced by DWT (−0.64) and indirectly via total organic carbon (TOC; −0.89). TOC and Eh are key drivers of microbial activity, which in turn shapes viral communities.  \n\n**Step 3: Link diversity trends to methane cycling**  \nDNA viruses carry auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) for methane metabolism (e.g., *pmoC*; Fig. 2), and their peak diversity at intermediate DWT aligns with higher methanogen activity in anoxic zones (15–20 cm). RNA viruses, lacking methane-related AMGs but encoding oxidative phosphorylation genes (e.g., *coxIII*), may instead influence host energy metabolism. The decline in RNA viral diversity with DWT suggests reduced aerobic host activity, indirectly affecting methane cycling by altering microbial turnover rates.  \n\n**Step 4: Synthesize ecological implications**  \nThe contrasting trends imply complementary roles: DNA viruses likely modulate methane production/oxidation via AMGs in anoxic layers, while RNA viruses may regulate aerobic microbial hosts, indirectly influencing methane flux. The DWT-driven shifts in viral diversity thus reflect niche partitioning, with DNA viruses more critical in deeper, anoxic peat and RNA viruses in oxic surface layers.  \n\n**Conclusion:** DWT differentially shapes viral α-diversity via redox and TOC, with DNA viruses peaking in intermediate anoxic zones (supporting methane cycling via AMGs) and RNA viruses declining with DWT (reflecting reduced aerobic host activity). These trends highlight viruses as mediators of methane dynamics through both direct (AMGs) and indirect (host regulation) pathways."

        "question": "What methodological considerations and limitations arise from using viromics and metatranscriptomics to identify and classify viral contigs in peatland sediments, particularly given the high proportion of unclassified viruses and the challenges in host prediction?",
        "answer": "**Question 2: What methodological considerations and limitations arise from using viromics and metatranscriptomics to identify and classify viral contigs in peatland sediments, particularly given the high proportion of unclassified viruses and the challenges in host prediction?**  \n\n**Step 1: Assess classification challenges**  \nThe context notes low taxonomic classification rates: only 22.1–29.6% of DNA viruses were classified at the family level (Table S4), and >70% remained unclassified (Fig. 1A). RNA viruses were classified using RdRp genes, but many lacked these markers (1,900 contigs discarded). This underscores limitations in reference databases and marker gene coverage for peatland viruses.  \n\n**Step 2: Evaluate host prediction limitations**  \nHost prediction (via iPHoP) yielded links for only ~10% of vOTUs (Fig. 4A), with most hosts uncharacterized. Cross-domain predictions (e.g., viruses infecting both bacteria and archaea) were rare (Table S7), suggesting current tools underestimate viral host range. Host prediction relied on CRISPR spacers and nucleotide composition, which may miss novel or divergent hosts.  \n\n**Step 3: Analyze AMG identification biases**  \nAMGs were identified by proximity to viral genes (Section 2.3.4), but host contamination risks persist. Functional annotation (KEGG) was limited by database biases; for example, RNA viral genes like *nuoG* (oxidative phosphorylation) were novel in peatlands (Section 3.2), indicating gaps in functional references.  \n\n**Step 4: Discuss methodological constraints**  \n- **Assembly challenges:** Contig length thresholds (5 kb for DNA, 300 bp for RNA) may exclude small viral genomes or fragmented RNA viruses.  \n- **RdRp dependency:** RNA virus identification required RdRp genes (Section 2.4.1), omitting viruses lacking this marker.  \n- **Comparative limitations:** Gene-sharing networks (Fig. 5A) revealed peat-specific viral clusters absent in RefSeq, highlighting database incompleteness.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Methodological limitations include low classification rates due to database gaps, host prediction inaccuracies, and AMG annotation biases. Improved tools for host linking (e.g., metagenome-assembled genomes) and expanded reference databases are needed to resolve peatland viral diversity and function."

        "question": "How do the identified auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) in DNA viruses and the functional genes in RNA viruses collectively contribute to the methane, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles in the Dajiuhu peatland, and what are the indirect pathways through which these viral functions influence pore water methane concentrations?",
        "answer": "**Question 3: How do the identified auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) in DNA viruses and the functional genes in RNA viruses collectively contribute to the methane, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles in the Dajiuhu peatland, and what are the indirect pathways through which these viral functions influence pore water methane concentrations?**  \n\n**Step 1: Catalog AMGs and functional genes**  \nDNA viruses encode AMGs for methane (*pmoC*, *mcrA*; Fig. 2), nitrogen (e.g., nitrite reductase), and sulfur metabolism (e.g., sulfate adenyltransferase). RNA viruses carry genes for oxidative phosphorylation (*coxIII*, *nuoG*) and cysteine synthesis (*CBS*; Section 3.2), indirectly linked to energy and sulfur cycling.  \n\n**Step 2: Link AMGs to biogeochemical cycles**  \n- **Methane:** DNA viral AMGs (*pmoC*) may enhance methane oxidation in hosts (e.g., *Beijerinckiaceae*; Fig. 4C), while *mcrA* could augment methanogenesis (e.g., in *Methanomicrobiales*).  \n- **Nitrogen/Sulfur:** Sulfur AMGs (e.g., *cysH*) may alter host sulfate reduction, influencing methane production via substrate competition.  \n\n**Step 3: Analyze indirect pathways to methane concentrations**  \nPLS-PM (Fig. 3B) shows DNA viruses affect pore water methane (Water-CH4) via AMG diversity (0.60) and community composition (0.87). RNA viruses influence Water-CH4 through community diversity (0.44) and composition (0.47), likely by regulating host energy metabolism (e.g., *nuoG* impacting aerobic methanotrophs).  \n\n**Step 4: Synthesize ecological impacts**  \nDNA viruses directly modulate methane cycling via AMGs, while RNA viruses indirectly alter methane flux by controlling host activity (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation genes affecting methanotroph efficiency). Both pathways are mediated by DWT-driven changes in Eh and TOC (Fig. 3B).  \n\n**Conclusion:** DNA viral AMGs directly participate in methane, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling, whereas RNA viral genes indirectly influence methane via host metabolic regulation. Hydrological conditions (DWT) integrate these effects by shaping viral and host community dynamics."
