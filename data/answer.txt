The observed discrepancies between modeled and observed PM2.5 concentrations, particularly in regions like the Pacific Northwest where wildfire activity has increased, can be attributed to several underlying factors:

1. **Uncertainties in Emission Inventories**: The study highlights that anthropogenic and biomass burning emission estimates vary significantly across different inventories (by factors of 1.16–2.94 for anthropogenic emissions and 3.13–8.0 for fire emissions). These uncertainties are exacerbated in wildfire-prone areas like the Pacific Northwest, where fire emissions are highly variable and challenging to quantify accurately. The Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINN) used in the study may not fully capture the temporal and spatial variability of wildfire emissions, leading to discrepancies.

2. **Limitations in Data Assimilation**: The assimilation of MODIS AOD retrievals in the CMAQ model improves PM2.5 simulations but has limitations. MODIS AOD retrievals do not provide information on the vertical distribution of aerosols, which is critical for accurately simulating PM2.5 concentrations, especially from wildfires where plume rise and vertical mixing are significant. The observation error for MODIS AOD increases with higher AOD values, restricting the data assimilation system's ability to correct model biases during high-pollution events like wildfires.

3. **Meteorological Uncertainties**: The WRF model, used to drive CMAQ, exhibits known biases in simulating winds and precipitation, particularly in complex terrains like the Pacific Northwest. These meteorological uncertainties can affect the dispersion and deposition of PM2.5, leading to discrepancies between modeled and observed concentrations.

4. **Model Representation of Processes**: The study notes that the model underestimates high PM2.5 events (95th percentile) in some regions, suggesting limitations in representing processes such as secondary aerosol formation, plume rise, and chemical aging of aerosols from wildfires. These processes are critical in regions with increasing wildfire activity.

5. **Extrapolation of Emission Trends**: The study extrapolates EPA National Emissions Inventory (NEI) base-year emissions to non-base years using state-level trends, which may not capture local changes or new emission sources. This approach can introduce errors in PM2.5 simulations, especially in regions with rapidly changing emission profiles due to wildfires.

**Impact on Trend Analyses Reliability**:
The discrepancies between modeled and observed PM2.5 concentrations can influence the reliability of trend analyses in several ways:
- **Underestimation of Wildfire Impacts**: The model's underestimation of high PM2.5 events (e.g., during wildfire seasons) may lead to an underestimation of increasing trends in PM2.5 in wildfire-prone regions like the Pacific Northwest. The study notes an increasing but statistically insignificant trend in summertime PM2.5 in the northwestern US, which could be more pronounced if wildfire impacts were fully captured.
- **Bias in Long-Term Trends**: Systematic biases in the model (e.g., mean biases of −0.9–5.6 µg m−3 for PM2.5) can affect the absolute magnitude of trend estimates. While the model captures the overall decreasing trends in PM2.5 over the CONUS, regional trends in areas with high wildfire activity may be less reliable due to these biases.
- **Seasonal and Percentile Trends**: The study finds that the 95th percentile PM2.5 time series shows sharper increases in recent years, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, but the model's ability to capture these extremes is limited. This affects the reliability of trend analyses for high-pollution events, which are critical for air quality management.

In summary, the discrepancies arise from uncertainties in emissions, limitations in data assimilation, meteorological biases, and process representation. These factors reduce the reliability of trend analyses in wildfire-prone regions, particularly for high-PM2.5 events and localized trends. The study acknowledges these challenges and provides uncertainty estimates to help users interpret the trends cautiously.
