How does the assimilation of MODIS AOD and MOPITT CO retrievals in the CMAQ model impact the accuracy of surface ozone and PM2.5 predictions compared to simulations without data assimilation, and what are the underlying mechanisms driving these improvements?
What are the key sources of uncertainty in the long-term air quality reanalysis dataset, and how do variations in anthropogenic and biomass burning emission inventories, meteorological parameters, and data assimilation techniques contribute to these uncertainties?
How do the observed trends in MDA8 ozone and PM2.5 concentrations across different land use types and geographic regions in the CONUS reflect the effectiveness of emission control policies, and what role do external factors like wildfires and transboundary pollution play in modulating these trends?
