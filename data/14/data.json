        "question": "How do the differential gene expression patterns observed in male and female mining region residents (MRR) reflect the sex-specific immune responses and epigenetic modifications, and what implications do these findings have for understanding the molecular mechanisms of long-term metal exposure?",
        "answer": "**Question 1: How do the differential gene expression patterns observed in male and female mining region residents (MRR) reflect the sex-specific immune responses and epigenetic modifications, and what implications do these findings have for understanding the molecular mechanisms of long-term metal exposure?**\n\n**Step 1: Identify sex-specific transcriptomic alterations in MRR**  \nThe study revealed distinct gene expression patterns between male and female MRR. Females exhibited a stronger immune response, evidenced by upregulated pathways like TNF-α signaling via NF-κB, IL-10 signaling, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions (Fig. 5B, Additional file 3: Spreadsheet 4). Males, however, showed dysregulation in ion transport (e.g., solute carriers, ATPases) and epigenetic modifications (e.g., histone deacetylation, DNA methylation) (Fig. 5A, Additional file 3: Spreadsheet 3).  \n\n**Step 2: Correlate immune responses with sex-specific genes**  \nAmong 159 known sex-specific immune genes, 42 were differentially expressed in males (e.g., *CXCR3*, *ARID5B*) and 5 in females (e.g., *TNF*, *XIST*) (Additional file 1: Fig. S5). *XIST* downregulation in females may enhance NF-κB activation, while *TNF* upregulation aligns with estrogen-mediated immune modulation. In males, decreased expression of histone demethylases (*KDM6A*, *UTY*) suggests epigenetic repression.  \n\n**Step 3: Link transcriptomic changes to metal exposure**  \nThe cumulative Z-Score of non-essential metals (As, Sb, Ni, Tl, Be) correlated with immune pathway activation (e.g., IFN-γ, TNF-α) and translation inhibition (e.g., *EIF3E*, *EEF1A1* downregulation) (Fig. 4B). Sex-specific responses imply hormonal (e.g., estrogen/testosterone) or epigenetic (e.g., *XIST* silencing) modulation of metal toxicity.  \n\n**Step 4: Implications for molecular mechanisms**  \nThe findings suggest:  \n1. **Adaptive stress responses**: Translation inhibition and chaperone upregulation (*HSPA1A*, *HSPA6*) indicate cellular adaptation to metal-induced stress.  \n2. **Sex-specific susceptibility**: Females may mount stronger inflammatory responses due to hormonal regulation, while males exhibit compensatory ion transport and epigenetic silencing.  \n3. **Chronic exposure biomarkers**: Dysregulated immune and epigenetic pathways highlight potential biomarkers for long-term metal exposure effects.  \n\n**Conclusion**: Sex-specific transcriptomic patterns reflect divergent immune and epigenetic adaptations to chronic metal exposure, emphasizing the need for sex-stratified risk assessments in mining populations."

        "question": "What methodological considerations and limitations arise from using the Nguyen Backward Selection Algorithm (NBSA) for factor optimization in the differential expression analysis, particularly in the context of sex-stratified analyses and cell-type composition adjustments?",
        "answer": "**Question 2: What methodological considerations and limitations arise from using the Nguyen Backward Selection Algorithm (NBSA) for factor optimization in the differential expression analysis, particularly in the context of sex-stratified analyses and cell-type composition adjustments?**  \n\n**Step 1: Describe NBSA workflow**  \nNBSA iteratively removes the least influential covariate (based on DEG association) until the main factor of interest (MFI, e.g., residency status) becomes least significant. Backtracking identifies the optimal covariate set maximizing DEG detection (Additional file 1: Fig. S4).  \n\n**Step 2: Evaluate sex-stratified optimization**  \n- **Unstratified analysis**: Smoking (correlated with sex) was retained over sex itself, potentially masking sex-specific effects (Additional file 1: Fig. S4A).  \n- **Stratified analysis**: Male MRR required fewer covariates (e.g., CD8+ T memory cells), while female MRR needed more (e.g., CD14+ monocytes, MAIT cells) (Additional file 1: Fig. S4B-C), reflecting sex-specific cell-type heterogeneity.  \n\n**Step 3: Assess cell-type adjustment challenges**  \n- **Obligatory factors**: Cell types like CD14+ monocytes and MAITs were critical for female MRR, aligning with their immune-rich transcriptome (Fig. 1).  \n- **Technical confounders**: Erythrocyte/platelet RNA residuals necessitated inclusion as covariates, especially in females (Additional file 1: Fig. S4C).  \n\n**Step 4: Limitations**  \n1. **Collinearity**: Smoking and sex were conflated, potentially biasing unstratified results.  \n2. **Sample size**: Stratification reduced statistical power, especially for females (167 DEGs vs. males’ 2,827).  \n3. **Cell-type resolution**: MuSiC-derived proportions may not capture rare subtypes, affecting precision.  \n\n**Conclusion**: NBSA optimizes covariate selection but requires careful handling of collinear variables and sex-specific heterogeneity. Stratified analyses improve specificity but demand larger cohorts."
