        "question": "How does the lack of standardized GO terms in the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) network impact the ability to integrate transcriptomics data for regulatory risk assessment, and what specific improvements are suggested by the authors to address this limitation?",
        "answer": "**Step 1: Identify the impact of lacking standardized GO terms in the AOP network**\nThe lack of standardized Gene Ontology (GO) terms in the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) network significantly hinders the integration of transcriptomics data for regulatory risk assessment. Specifically:\n- Only 43% of Key Events (KEs) in the AOP network included GO Biological Process (BP) terms (Table 1), limiting automated mapping of transcriptomics data to KEs.\n- The data-driven approach yielded only 6 unique KEs connected to GO BP terms from transcriptomics data (Table 3), demonstrating poor interoperability due to inconsistent ontology usage.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the consequences of this limitation**\n- **Reduced efficiency**: Manual expert-driven mapping was required to connect GO terms to KEs, which was time-consuming and introduced subjectivity (Section 3.3.1).\n- **Weak evidence linkage**: Broad GO terms (e.g., \"regulation of gene expression\") provided insufficient specificity to support KE mechanisms (e.g., androgen receptor signaling) (Section 4).\n- **Knowledge gaps**: 8 GO BP terms for Cd and 17 for PCB126 tagged as endocrine-related couldn't be connected to any KE, indicating missing pathways in the AOP network (Table 4).\n\n**Step 3: Extract suggested improvements from the context**\nThe authors propose:\n1. **Harmonizing AOP development**: Standardizing KE annotations with specific GO terms (e.g., \"androgen receptor signaling pathway\" instead of \"regulation of gene expression\") to improve machine readability and evidence strength (Section 4).\n2. **FAIR principles**: Ensuring AOPs are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable by attaching accurate standardized terms during AOP development (Section 4).\n3. **Combining methodologies**: Supplementing transcriptomics with targeted assays (e.g., receptor binding or enzyme activity) to bridge gaps in molecular-level MIEs (Section 4).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the implications**\nThe lack of standardized terms undermines confidence in data integration and necessitates labor-intensive manual curation. Improved ontology use would enable automated, objective linkages between transcriptomics and AOPs, as demonstrated by successful case studies like Jaylet et al. (2024) (Section 4)."

        "question": "Compare and contrast the data-driven versus expert-driven approaches for connecting Gene Ontology (GO) terms to Key Events (KEs) in the AOP network, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each method based on the results presented in Tables 3 and 4.",
        "answer": "**Step 1: Define data-driven and expert-driven approaches**\n- **Data-driven**: Automatically connects GO terms to KEs by matching GO IDs in the AOP network with experimental data. Only 6 KEs were linked this way (Table 3).\n- **Expert-driven**: Manual mapping based on semantic similarity between GO term descriptions and KE descriptions. Connected 55 KEs for Cd and 64 for PCB126 (Table 4).\n\n**Step 2: Compare advantages and disadvantages using Tables 3 and 4**\n- **Data-driven advantages**: \n  - Objective and scalable (Section 3.3.1).\n  - Limited to existing GO annotations, missing 57% of KEs without standardized terms (Table 1).\n- **Data-driven disadvantages**: \n  - Overly broad GO terms (e.g., \"regulation of hormone levels\" for thyroxine-specific KEs) weaken evidence (Table 3).\n  - Misses indirect connections (e.g., steroid metabolism linked to reproductive toxicity).\n\n- **Expert-driven advantages**:\n  - Captures indirect relationships (e.g., \"synapse assembly\" linked to \"decrease of synaptogenesis\") (Section 3.3.1).\n  - Identifies knowledge gaps (e.g., unconnected endocrine-related GO terms) (Table 4).\n- **Expert-driven disadvantages**:\n  - Time-intensive and subjective (Section 4).\n  - Requires domain expertise to resolve conflicts (e.g., contradictory GO MF terms for UDP-glycosyltransferase activity).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate methodological implications**\n- **Data-driven**: Relies on AOP-Wiki completeness; current heterogeneity in ontology usage limits utility (Section 3.1).\n- **Expert-driven**: More comprehensive but impractical for large-scale applications. Highlights need for better KE annotations (Section 4).\n\n**Step 4: Derive conclusions from results**\nThe expert-driven approach provided more meaningful connections but is unsustainable without improved standardization. Hybrid methods (e.g., computational tools with manual curation, as in Saarim√§ki et al., 2023) may balance efficiency and accuracy (Section 4)."

        "question": "What evidence from the transcriptomics data supports the endocrine-disrupting properties of Cadmium (Cd) and PCB-126, and how do the Enrichment Maps and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) results complement the AOP network analysis in identifying these effects?",
        "answer": "**Step 1: Identify transcriptomics evidence for endocrine disruption**\n- **Cadmium (Cd)**:\n  - Upstream regulators: Androgen receptor (AR), beta-estradiol, and GPER1 with significant Z-scores (Fig. 4).\n  - GO BP terms: \"Regulation of hormone secretion\" (GO:0046883) and steroid metabolism terms linked to EATS-mediated parameters (Table 5).\n- **PCB-126**:\n  - Upstream regulators: ESRRA, L-triiodothyronine, and NCOA1/3 (Fig. 4).\n  - GO BP terms: \"Steroid metabolism\" (GO:0008202) and \"estrogen metabolism\" (GO:0008210) (Section 3.3.1).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze complementary support from Enrichment Maps and IPA**\n- **Enrichment Maps**:\n  - Cd: Upregulated immune responses and downregulated neurodevelopment (Table 2), aligning with thyroid-mediated neurotoxicity KEs (Fig. 5).\n  - PCB126: Disrupted steroid metabolism and neuronal signaling (Table 2), consistent with AhR-mediated CYP enzyme induction (Section 4).\n- **IPA**:\n  - Predicted activation of endocrine pathways (e.g., AR, thyroid receptor) corroborated AOP network connections (Fig. 4).\n  - Non-EATS regulators (e.g., PPARGC1A) highlighted cross-talk between metabolic and endocrine systems (Section 3.2.2).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize evidence within the AOP framework**\n- Both compounds showed:\n  - Direct links to hormone regulation KEs (e.g., \"Thyroxine in neuronal tissue, Decreased\" via GO:0010817) (Table 3).\n  - Downstream effects on neurodevelopment and reproduction via shared KEs (Figs. 5, 6).\n- PCB126 specifically demonstrated AhR-mediated steroid disruption, supported by IPA's \"benzo(a)pyrene\" upstream regulator (Fig. 4).\n\n**Step 4: Contextualize findings**\nThe integration of transcriptomics, Enrichment Maps, and IPA validated known endocrine mechanisms (e.g., Cd's thyroid effects, PCB126's AhR activation) while revealing gaps (e.g., tissue-specific effects) that could be addressed with single-cell RNA-Seq (Section 4)."
