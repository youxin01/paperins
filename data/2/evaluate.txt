- Answer Error Analysis: Step 1 incorrectly cites the relative difference for GWP100 as 3.6×, which is not supported by Table 3 or Supplementary Table 9; the correct value is 4.1× (10.24/2.47). Step 2 misinterprets the similarity between GWP100 and GTP100, as the context indicates a slight decline in vegan advantage for GTP100. Step 3 oversimplifies temporal dynamics by not addressing the context’s note on gas composition assumptions, reducing rigor.

- Answer Error Analysis: Step 2 introduces external assumptions about irrigation practices and local ecosystems not explicitly stated in the context, reducing rigor. Step 3 fails to address the Monte Carlo analysis’s role in uncertainty propagation, missing a key methodological factor from the context. The conclusion oversimplifies the impact on confidence without referencing the context’s note on correlated uncertainties across diet groups.

- Answer Error Analysis: Step 1 inaccurately generalizes the sensitivity analysis range (5–38%) as applying to GHG emissions, whereas the context specifies this range for all environmental indicators (e.g., CH4 at 5%, water use at 38%). Step 3 introduces the term "overconsumption" for meat-eaters’ higher kcal intake, which is not explicitly supported by the context and implies an external judgment. The answer lacks detailed discussion of specific environmental indicators beyond GHG emissions, reducing rigor.
