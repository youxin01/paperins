Modelled dietary scenarios often fail to refect true dietary practice and do not account for variation in the environmental burden of food due to sourcing and production methods. Here we link dietary data from a sample of 55,504 vegans, vegetarians, fsh-eaters and meat-eaters with food-level data on greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use, eutrophication risk and potential biodiversity loss from a review of 570 life-cycle assessments covering more than 38,000 farms in 119 countries. Our results include the variation in food production and sourcing that is observed in the review of life-cycle assessments. All environmental indicators showed a positive association with amounts of animal-based food consumed. Dietary impacts of vegans were 25.1% (95% uncertainty interval, 15.1–37.0%) of high meat-eaters (≥100 g total meat consumed per day) for greenhouse gas emissions, 25.1% (7.1–44.5%) for land use, 46.4% (21.0–81.0%) for water use, 27.0% (19.4–40.4%) for eutrophication and 34.3% (12.0–65.3%) for biodiversity. At least 30% diferences were found between low and high meat-eaters for most indicators. Despite substantial variation due to where and how food is produced, the relationship between environmental impact and animal-based food consumption is clear and should prompt the reduction of the latter.

The substantial impact of the global food system on the environment is well established. It is estimated that the food system was responsible for 18 Gt of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2015, comprising 34% of total global GHG emissions that year[1](#page-7-0) . The food system is also responsible for 70% of the world's freshwater use and 78% of freshwater pollution[2,](#page-7-1)[3](#page-7-2) . About three quarters of the World's ice-free land area has been affected by human use, primarily agricultur[e4](#page-7-3) , and land-use change (primarily deforestation for agriculture) is a major source of biodiversity loss[5](#page-7-4),[6](#page-7-5) .

To feed a growing global population while remaining within proposed safe environmental boundaries for GHG emissions, land use, water use, water pollution and biodiversity loss, we will need changes in diet[s7](#page-7-6) . Other means to reduce the environmental impact of the food system (for example, technological advances, closing yield gaps, reducing food waste) will not be enough without major dietary change[7,](#page-7-6)[8](#page-7-7) . The environmental impact of animal-based foods is generally higher than for plant-based foods because of both direct processes related to livestock management (for example, methane (CH4) production by

Systematic reviews of modelled dietary scenarios have shown that vegan and vegetarian diets have substantially lower GHG emissions, land use and water use requirements than meat-containing diets[11,](#page-7-10)[12](#page-7-11) and that diets with reduced animal-based foods tend to be healthier and have lower environmental impac[t13.](#page-7-12) However, modelled dietary scenarios may not reflect true dietary practice, and modelled environmental and health outcomes can be strongly affected by assumptions made by the modellers. Also, previous modelled dietary scenarios have not reflected the considerable variation in environmental indicators due to both region of food production and agricultural production methods[3](#page-7-2) and therefore will have underestimated the uncertainty associated with their findings. While we continue to use average values of environmental impact for food categories, we cannot know whether the observed differences in environmental impact between dietary groups still exist after accounting for variation in food production systems. We therefore need to link data from dietary surveys of real-life dietary patterns with large datasets of environmental indicators to ascertain whether the relationship between animal-based food consumption and environmental outcomes shown in modelling studies is robust.

Previously, we estimated the dietary GHG emissions associated with real-life diet groups in the UK[14](#page-7-13). These estimates only captured one aspect of the environmental impact of food systems, and the data for GHG emissions were derived from a single source with no information about variation within individual food groups due to sourcing or productio[n15.](#page-7-14) Also, GHG emissions data were not presented as disaggregated gases, losing climatically important information[16](#page-7-15). In this paper, we link a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to estimates from a review of 570 life-cycle assessments[3](#page-7-2) (LCAs) to estimate the GHG emissions (CH4, nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), in addition to combined CO2e emissions), water use, land use, water pollution and biodiversity impact associated with observed diets of vegans, vegetarians, fish-eaters and meat-eaters in the UK (Fig. [1](#page-1-0)). Our approach allows for direct comparisons of the environmental indicators for each diet group, incorporating uncertainty due to food sourcing and production, and individual-level diet choice.

#### **Results**

The participants and their dietary intake are described in Table [1.](#page-2-0) Vegans and vegetarians were younger than fish-eaters and meat-eaters, and vegans reported a lower dietary intake of energy than all other diet groups. Fish consumption was similar in fish-eaters and low meat-eaters (with higher levels of consumption in medium and high meat-eaters), suggesting that fish-eaters were not replacing meat with fish. While total dairy consumption was lower in vegetarians and fish-eaters compared to meat-eaters, there was higher consumption of cheese in these two groups.

Estimates of environmental indicators of the diet groups are shown in Tables [2](#page-3-0)[–4,](#page-4-0) and relative impacts compared to the high meat-eaters are shown in Figs. [2](#page-3-1) and [3.](#page-5-0) The uncertainty associated with sourcing and production is highly correlated between diet groups. This is because food-level draws that produce Monte Carlo iterations with low estimates for the vegan diet group are highly likely to produce low estimates of environmental impact for all other diet groups. For this reason, the results in Tables [2–](#page-3-0)[4](#page-4-0) can be used to show uncertainty in absolute estimates of environmental impact for any single diet group, but for comparisons between diet groups the results in Figs. [2](#page-3-1) and [3](#page-5-0) should be used (which account for the correlation in the uncertainty between diet groups). The results shown in Figs. [2](#page-3-1) and [3](#page-5-0) represent re-analyses of the dataset and cannot simply be calculated from the

data presented in Tables [2–](#page-3-0)[4](#page-4-0). Tables with full results for these figures are provided in Supplementary Tables 8–10.

For GHG emissions, there was a positive association with amount of animal-based food consumption (Table [2,](#page-3-0) Fig. [2](#page-3-1) and Supplementary Table 8). Dietary CO2 emissions for vegans were 30.3% (17.0–45.5%) of the high meat-eaters group. There were also substantial differences in dietary CO2 emissions between groups of meat-eaters. Dietary CO2 emissions of low meat-eaters were 57.2% (37.8–74.9%) of the high meat-eaters. CH4 is a GHG that, in terms of agricultural emissions, is predominantly associated with production of ruminants—it is therefore unsurprising to see wide disparities in CH4 emissions associated with the different diet groups. CH4 emissions from high meat-eaters were 15.3 (10.3–27.1) times higher than from vegan diets. N2O emissions are predominantly associated with fertilizer use, and therefore gradients in N2O emissions by diet group are mostly a result of the inefficiencies associated with raising crops for animal feed. This gradient is shallower than for CH4 but still substantial, with N2O emissions for high meat-eaters 3.6 (2.4–6.0) times higher than for vegans.

Table [3](#page-4-1) (and Supplementary Table 9 for relative differences between diet groups) show that using the 100-year Global Temperature change Potential (GTP100) measure resulted in smaller aggregated GHG footprints for all diets, as would be expected given the lower valuation of both N2O and especially CH4 compared to 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100). The ranking of different dietary emission footprints remained the same, but the relative advantage of vegans over diets incorporating animal products decline slightly, with the high meat-eaters responsible for 3.6 (2.4–6.1) times greater GTP100

emissions than vegans, and low meat-eaters 1.8 (1.4–2.6) times greater. For the 20-year Global Warming Potential (GWP20), all footprints were greater, and the relative difference between vegan and other footprints was even more pronounced: high meat-eater diets were 5.1 (3.5–8.4) times greater than vegans.

Table [4,](#page-4-0) Fig. [3](#page-5-0) and Supplementary Table 10 show results for land use, water use, eutrophication and biodiversity impact, all of which show trends in environmental burden from vegans (lowest) to high meat-eaters (highest). For both land use and eutrophication, there is a large difference between the high meat-eaters and all other groups. For eutrophication, the low-meat diet has an impact that is 57.4% (49.6– 68.4%) of the high-meat-eating group. For land use, the impact of low meat-eaters is 43.8% (20.7–65.4%) of the high meat-eaters. For both water use and biodiversity impact, there are much bigger gaps for the plant-based groups (for water use, the gap emerges for vegetarians and vegans, whereas for biodiversity impact, it applies to vegans only). However, for both of these environmental indicators, there is far less certainty in both absolute estimates for individual diet groups and also in comparisons between diet groups. Figure [3](#page-5-0) shows how this uncertainty propagates, with far wider uncertainty intervals for water use and biodiversity impact than for other measures. For example, the biodiversity impact of vegetarian diets is estimated to be 64.8% of high meat-eaters, but the uncertainty interval (24.5–102.3%) overlap with parity between the groups. The larger uncertainty intervals for these two environmental indicators reflect wide variations in the food-level LCAs.

The results of our sensitivity analyses where we did not standardize diets to 2,000 kcal d−1 are shown in Supplementary Section 3 (with equivalent results for the regression-based results in Supplementary Section 2). As shown in Table [1,](#page-2-0) the measured kilocalorie content of the diet is higher in meat-eaters than in vegetarians and vegans, and high meat-eaters have higher measured kilocalorie intake than low meat-eaters. Therefore, it is unsurprising that not standardizing for kilocalorie intake amplifies the differences in environmental impact across diet groups. In the sensitivity analysis, the environmental footprint of vegan diets is between 5% (CH4) and 38% (water use) of the footprint of high meat-eaters. For low meat-eaters, the impact is between 37% (land use) and 67% (water use) of high meat-eaters.

#### **Discussion**

#### **Statement of principal findings**

Diet-related environmental impacts vary substantially by diet groups within this cohort of UK adults which includes a large sample of vegans, vegetarians and fish-eaters. For measures of GHG emissions, land use, water use, eutrophication and biodiversity, the level of impact is strongly associated with the amount of animal-based products that are consumed. Point estimates for vegan diets were associated with less than half of the impact of high-meat-eater (>100 g d−1) diets for all indicators, and 95% uncertainty intervals were below 50% for all outcomes except water use and biodiversity. There are also large differences in the environmental impact of diets for groups with lower (but still some) meat consumption. For GHG emissions, eutrophication and land use, the impact for low meat-eaters was at least 30% lower than for high meat-eaters. Large food-level variation in the environmental indicators due to region of origin and method of food production does not obscure differences between diet groups.

#### **Implications of research**

The UK has a legal commitment to a 78% reduction in GHG emissions by 2035 compared to 1990[17](#page-7-16) and of halting biodiversity loss by 203[018](#page-8-0). The UK Committee on Climate Change has stated that if the government is to achieve its ambitious targets for carbon reductions, then rapid progress must be made across all sectors including implementing measures to encourage consumers to shift diets[19](#page-8-1). Shifts in diets towards plant-based consumption was also emphasized in the 2021 National Food Strategy, which called for a 30% reduction in meat consumption[20.](#page-8-2) Previous scenario modelling work has shown that global improvements in food technology, closure of yield gaps and reductions in food waste could potentially reduce dietary GHG emissions by about 15%, primarily through adoption of more efficient technologies in lowand middle-income countries[7](#page-7-6) . Our results suggest that much bigger reductions can be achieved by increasing the uptake of plant-based diets, which aligns with other results from this field[7](#page-7-6)[,8](#page-7-7)[,11.](#page-7-10)

There are many population-level interventions that could be implemented to support transitions towards lower meat diets. The UK Health Alliance on Climate Change recommends that sustainable

diets should be supported by mandatory environmental labelling on foods, regulation of promotions and taxation of high-carbon foods[21.](#page-8-3) All of these are variants on policies aimed at increasing healthy diets that either have already been introduced (for example, traffic light labelling, the UK Soft Drink Industry Levy) or have been proposed in the UK Childhood Obesity Pla[n22.](#page-8-4) The UK Government's dietary policy is underpinned by its food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs), known as the Eatwell Guide[23.](#page-8-5) A recent systematic review of national FBDGs found that the large majority are not compatible with the proposed downscaling of 'planetary boundaries' for food production—if the UK population consumed the diet recommended by the Eatwell Guide, it would not stay within boundaries for GHG emissions, water use, land use and eutrophication suggested by the paper[24](#page-8-6). Incorporating environmental sustainability into FBDGs (such as the Eatwell Guide proposed by Plant-based Health Professionals U[K25](#page-8-7)) may be the first step towards implementation of population-level policies that have been shown to support shifts away from animal-based food[s26.](#page-8-8)

#### **Strengths and limitations**

This paper uses one of the largest datasets available on the diets of vegans and vegetarians to compare the environmental impact of different diet groups over ten environmental measures. The analyses contribute to the literature that shows the benefit of low-meat diets for reduction of GHG emissions[14](#page-7-13), land use, water use, water pollution and biodiversity. The paper uses only empirical measures of diet, thereby verifying previous modelling work that has suggested multiple environmental benefits of low-meat diet[s7](#page-7-6)[,8](#page-7-7)[,27](#page-8-9). By using self-identification as vegan, vegetarian and fish-eater, we ensure that our methods include all dietary patterns within those categories including those that breach some of the definitions of the groups—this means our estimates are likely to reflect real dietary practices as opposed to comparison of idealized diet groups.

A key strength of our analysis is that it incorporates the uncertainty around the environmental parameters drawn from a review of 570 LCAs covering results from over 38,000 farms in 119 countries covering five continents[3](#page-7-2) —henceforth, 'the Poore and Nemecek database'. Doing this shows that although uncertainty for any single food group is large, when this uncertainty is combined over multiple food groups to produce aggregated dietary estimates, we can still observe clear differences between diet groups. Our primary results are based on a Monte Carlo analysis where 1,000 estimates of each food's environmental impact are produced based on varying measures due to food sourcing and production methods. In our secondary results (shown in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 and based on regression models that take the median estimate of the environmental parameter for each food group and ignore the underlying variation), not only are the confidence intervals much tighter than in the primary analysis, but the point estimates are also lower. The discrepancy between the two sets of results is due to the computational mathematics involved with combining multiple distributions, many of which are heavily right-skewed, all of which are bounded by zero, and in which negative



<span id="page-3-1"></span>**Fig. 2 | Relative environmental footprint from GHG emissions of diet groups in comparison to high meat-eaters (>100 g d−1).** Uncertainty intervals are 2.5th to 97.5th percentiles of a Monte Carlo analysis (*n* = 1,000).

scalars are not possible (as negative consumption of food is not possible). Although each random draw from the food group distributions is equally likely to be either lower or higher than the median, draws that are higher than the median are, on average, further from the median than those that are lower. When summed, these random draws produce median estimates that are larger than the sum of the medians for the individual food groups. The same principle is shown by rolling two dice. For two normal 1–6 dice (which have no skew), the median score when rolling two dice is 7, which is twice the median score for rolling each dice separately (3½). However, consider rolling two 'doubling dice' from backgammon that are heavily right-skewed (with faces 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64). Here, the median score when rolling two dice is 35, much higher than the sum of the median scores for each single dice (which is 12).

Our secondary results (shown in the Supplementary Information) show that ignoring the uncertainty around food-level parameters can result in both underestimation of the uncertainty in diet-level outcomes and bias in the results which can reduce observed differences between diet groups. For example, our primary results show a difference in water use between high meat-eaters and vegans of 480 l d−1, with high meat-eaters consuming 2.2 times as much water as vegans, whereas the secondary results show an absolute difference of 210 l d−1 and a relative difference of 1.7. The issue of food-level uncertainty affects all areas of nutritional epidemiology that rely on food diaries or FFQs to estimate dietary intake. For example, estimates of sugar consumption produced by these methods do not account for uncertainty in the sugar level of food groups, but we know that wide variability in sugar levels for similar foods exists[28](#page-8-10).

Results presented for all adults (*N* = 55,504). All results are presented as median (2.5th percentile, 97.5th percentile) from a Monte Carlo analysis with 1,000 iterations.

An additional contribution of our research was providing disaggregated GHG emissions and exploring multiple CO2-equivalence metrics, whereas most previous studies report only GWP100 CO2e. Reporting emissions only as aggregated GWP100 totals results in ambiguity in climate impacts[29](#page-8-11), whereas providing footprints under multiple metrics gives users insight into temporal differences where there are both short- and long-lived gases involved, as highlighted by the Life Cycle Initiative[30.](#page-8-12) As food system emissions contain important amounts of CH4, a relatively short-lived gas, metric selection can have a pronounced impact on CO2e emission reporting[31.](#page-8-13) Here, however, using the alternative pulse-emission metrics explored in this study did not greatly affect results, with a fairly small change in total footprints and relative performance between dietary groups. A caveat is that emissions data from the Poore and Nemecek database are not separated into different gases, and while they are categorized to broadly infer gas compositions (for example, assuming that the CO2e emissions reported for fertilizer application represented N2O, and enteric fermentation CO2e represented CH4), for other components we had to assume emissions were entirely CO2. We reiterate calls for studies on GHG emissions, particularly those relating to agriculture and food, to provide disaggregated emissions to enable the most reliable analyses[31.](#page-8-13)
