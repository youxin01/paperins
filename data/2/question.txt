How might the environmental impact discrepancies between high meat-eaters and vegans change if the analysis accounted for regional variations in agricultural practices, such as differences in water use efficiency or land management techniques, beyond the current scope of the Poore and Nemecek database?
Given the observed correlation between dietary energy intake and environmental impact, what methodological adjustments would be necessary to isolate the effect of dietary composition (e.g., animal-based vs. plant-based foods) from total caloric intake when assessing environmental footprints?
How could the uncertainty intervals for biodiversity impact and water use be refined in future studies to reduce the overlap between diet groups, particularly given the wide variations observed in life-cycle assessments for these indicators?
