# ABSTRACT

The transmission of viruses through aerosols is of growing public health concern, yet research on aerosolassociated viral communities lags behind that of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Here, DNA viral diversity in natural aerosols from both over land and ocean in the East Asia region was examined. The results showed that atmospheric environments harbor a distinct viral community that differs from those present in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. A comparison of aerosol samples from different locations revealed that aerosol viruses are strongly influenced by altitude and their sources. Fragments of viruses that can infect pathogenic bacteria, as well as pathogenic viruses (such as herpesviruses, Inoviruses, and Iridovirus) were detected. Anthropogenicallyinfluenced land aerosol samples contained viral communities with greater richness and diversity as well as a higher relative abundance of pathogenic and lytic viruses compared to pristine marine airborne samples. Furthermore, habitat-specific auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) were observed, such as the phosphate regulon (*phoH*), which was more prevalent in ocean aerosol samples and regulates phosphate uptake under lowphosphate conditions, thereby assisting viral hosts in overcoming metabolic challenges in different environmental conditions. This study highlights the ecological distinctness of the airborne viral community and the interconnectedness between those from land, sea, and atmosphere, underscoring the importance of evaluating their potential pathogenicity in future research.

**1. Introduction**

Global aerosol emissions are approximately 2000 Mt per year ([Shao](#page-10-0)  [et al., 2011\)](#page-10-0). Rapid urbanization, industrial growth, and increasing energy consumption in East Asia in particular, have inevitably led to a deterioration in air quality [\(An et al., 2019\)](#page-10-0). These human activities directly or indirectly exert pressure on the atmosphere, influencing microbial emissions from the surface, biodiversity, and metabolic activity within the air ([Santl-Temkiv et al., 2022](#page-10-0)). Many studies have

highlighted the diverse nature of airborne microbial communities, which are comparable to those found in terrestrial environments ([Womack et al., 2010\)](#page-10-0).

Viruses have a dual significance. On the one hand, viruses that infect bacteria and archaea, known as phages, play a crucial role in ecosystem functions by influencing microbial population dynamics, facilitating nutrient cycling, and promoting genetic diversity within host organisms ([Du et al., 2023; Coutinho et al., 2017](#page-10-0)). The movement of bioaerosols, including viruses, through processes like monsoons, cloud formation,

and precipitation, is thus essential for sustaining biodiversity and resilience in terrestrial and marine ecosystems [\(Santl-Temkiv et al., 2022;](#page-10-0)  [Womack et al., 2010\)](#page-10-0). On the other hand, bioaerosols can also have serious health impacts by spreading pathogens in animals and plants, facilitating the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes and microbialderived allergens ([Lai et al., 2009; Brown and Hovm](#page-10-0)øller, 2002; Pal [et al., 2016; Woo et al., 2013\)](#page-10-0). Some of these viruses in aerosols are responsible for human diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ([Peiris et al., 2004; Nikitin et al., 2014; Zuo et al., 2020](#page-10-0)). Despite these critical roles, the composition and dynamics of viral communities in the air remain poorly characterized. This is primarily due to the low density of viral particles in aerosols, the absence of universally conserved marker genes (such as bacterial 16S rRNA genes) for identification, and the lack of well-annotated viral genomic databases [\(Prussin et al., 2014](#page-10-0)). These limitations have hindered the understanding of airborne viral communities [\(Prussin et al., 2014; Kuske, 2006\)](#page-10-0).

To date, research on airborne viral communities has predominantly focused on viral composition in specific indoor environments (e.g., daycare center, subways, residences, dormitory, and wastewater treatment center) and outdoor areas with strong human impact (e.g., piers and public transit hubs), suggesting that the distribution of viruses is strongly influenced by human activity ([Du et al., 2023; Rosario et al.,](#page-10-0)  [2018; Danko et al., 2021; Brisebois et al., 2018; Leung et al., 2021\)](#page-10-0). For example, antimicrobial resistance genes were detected in viruses inhabiting surfaces frequently touched by occupants and in viruses found on occupants' skin [\(Du et al., 2023\)](#page-10-0). Viral pathogens were frequently identified in the air of wastewater treatment centers ([Brisebois et al., 2018](#page-10-0)), cattle processing area of animal slaughterhouse ([Hall et al., 2013\)](#page-10-0), and university dormitories ([Rosario et al., 2018\)](#page-10-0). In these studies, the diversity, composition, and metabolic functions of the viral community are found to be habitat-dependent. However, the understanding of the viral communities present in outdoor natural air remains limited. Existing studies show that the abundance of outdoor airborne viruses exhibited seasonal variations and was inversely correlated with temperature and absolute humidity ([Whon et al., 2012](#page-10-0)). As regards the viral community, the most abundant viruses in PM2.5 and PM10 (particulate matter with nominal mean aerodynamic diameters of ≤ 2.5 and ≤ 10 μm, respectively) during a severe smog event were *Pseudomonas* phage F116, adenovirus C, and *Enterobacter* phage P1 [\(Cao](#page-10-0)  [et al., 2014\)](#page-10-0). Viruses may travel bidirectionally between the air and sea, as suggested by the presence of shared viral populations at both the airsea interface and in rainwater [\(Rahlff et al., 2023](#page-10-0)). Despite the progress made thus far, there remain important scientific questions to be explored in this field. Particularly, is the viral community present in the air distinct from those found in other ecosystems, such as soil and marine environments? What is the interconnectedness between viral communities from land, sea, and atmosphere? How do different habitats, e.g., aerosols over land and sea, affect the diversity and composition of aerosol viral communities, as well as their lifestyle and interaction with hosts?

In this study, DNA viral communities from aerosol samples collected over both land and sea in the East Asia region—specifically from Qingdao, a coastal city in China, and the East China Sea—were analyzed. The detection of a wide variety of viruses in air samples underscores the atmospheric environment as a significant yet understudied reservoir of viral diversity. The distributions of these airborne viruses reveal interconnections and variations influenced by the surrounding marine, terrestrial, and soil environments, highlighting their role in shaping the global viral ecosystem.

## **2. Materials and methods**

# *2.1. Sample collection, metagenomic sequencing, and microscopic photography*

Land aerosol samples were collected at Baguan Mountain in Qingdao (36.06◦N,120.34◦E), a coastal city in China, using a high-volume sampler (KC-1000, Qingdao Laoshan Elec. Inc., China) in July, August, September and November 2022 (Table S1, [Fig. 1\)](#page-2-0). Total suspended particles in the atmosphere were collected on acid-washed cellulose filters (Whatman-41) at a constant flow rate of 1.05 m3 air min<sup>−</sup> 1 for 24 h. The collection method in this study may have missed capturing some free-living viruses in the air, despite the airborne viral particles tend to associate with suspended particles [\(Aller et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2011](#page-10-0)). However, the previous study has suggested that metagenomes, which sequence the entire microbial community (including viruses, bacteria, archaea, etc.) offer an advantage over viromes (viral metagenomics) in detecting slow-growing, low-biomass communities and lysogenic viruses ([Kosmopoulos et al., 2024\)](#page-10-0). The collected filters were stored at − 80 ◦C. Samples were collected once a week; the four samples from each month were pooled and sequenced to ensure the representativeness of each month. Ocean aerosol samples were collected in April; October and November of 2022 using the same sampler during two cruises in the East China Sea (Table S1, [Fig. 1](#page-2-0)). Samples from two consecutive days were pooled and subjected to library preparation and sequencing. The total DNA on the cellulose filters was extracted using the CTAB Extraction Method by Novogene (Tianjin, China). Library construction and high throughput sequencing of the DNA were performed using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (pair-end sequencing, 2 × 150 bp) platform [\(Gao et al.,](#page-10-0)  [2022\)](#page-10-0).

The prepared aerosol filters were sonicated and suspended in Ultrapure water. Then, the samples were incubated with the nucleic acid stain SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes) in the dark at 80 ◦C for 10 min. Following a 5-minute dark treatment, images were captured using an AX/AX R confocal microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

#### *2.2. Quality control, assembly, and identification of viral contigs*

The raw reads were adapter-trimmed using fastp (v0.12.4) ([Chen](#page-10-0)  [et al., 2018\)](#page-10-0). The resulting high-quality paired-end reads were then filtered using Perl scripts, applying the following conditions: (1) no more than 20 % of bases with a quality score below 20, and (2) no more than 30 % of bases with a quality score below 30 [\(Gu et al., 2021](#page-10-0)). The Data volume after quality control is 55 GB ± 13 (Table S1). High-quality reads from each sample were assembled using metaSPAdes (v3.13.0) ([Nurk et al., 2017\)](#page-10-0). Contigs shorter than 1.5 kb were discarded, and the remaining contigs (*>*1.5 kb) were piped through DeepVirFinder (v1.0) ([Ren et al., 2020\)](#page-10-0) and VirSorter2 (v2.2.2) ([Guo et al., 2021\)](#page-10-0) to identify viral contigs. This involved using (1) DeepVirFinder with a score ≥ 0.9 and *p <* 0.01; (2) VirSorter2 with a score ≥ 0.9; and (3) DeepVirFinder with a score between 0.7 and 0.9 and *p* between 0.01 and 0.05, when VirSorter2 scores between 0.5 and 0.9. A total of 602,454 contigs with a length over 1.5 kb were assembled from the eight aerosol samples and 26,753 potential viral contigs were identified.

## *2.3. Dereplication and calculation of relative abundances and taxonomic profiling*

Viral contigs were grouped into viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) using CD-HIT (v4.8.1) with a threshold of ≥ 95 % nucleotide identity across ≥ 80 % of shorter contigs [\(Fu et al., 2012](#page-10-0)). The longest contig in each vOTU was then selected as the representative sequence, resulting in 24,835 vOTUs. To ensure the quality and confidence of the identified vOTUs, CheckV [\(Nayfach et al., 2021](#page-10-0)) was used to select vOTUs based on the following criteria: 1) longer than 5 kb and 2) complete vOTUs ranging from 1.5 kb-5 kb in length. Additionally, the

**Fig. 1.** Sampling stations of aerosols. As the trajectory of the vessel did not follow a perfectly straight line, the straight lines and arrows depicted here only represent where aerosol sampling was conducted during the voyage between the two stations. The colors and numbers on the right side represent the altitude of the land and the depth of the ocean.

viral and host gene counts from CheckV were used for false positive screening. Only vOTUs meeting the following conditions were retained after length-based screening: 1) viral\_gene *>* 0 or 2) viral\_gene = 0 AND host\_gene = 0. After applying these criteria, 846 vOTUs were selected for subsequent analysis.

The relative abundances of these vOTUs in each sample were calculated by mapping clean reads to the vOTUs using CoverM [\(Aroney](#page-10-0)  [et al., 2025\)](#page-10-0) (v0.7.0; [https://github.com/wwood/CoverM\)](https://github.com/wwood/CoverM) (with parameters –min-read-percent-identity 0.95 –min-read-aligned-percent 0.75). VITAP (v1.7) [\(Wang et al., 2024](#page-10-0)) and geNomad (v1.8.1) ([Camargo et al., 2023\)](#page-10-0) were utilized to assign the vOTUs. The lifestyle of the viruses (including the lytic and lysogenic lifestyle) was determined by VIBRANT (v1.2.1) using the default parameters ([Kieft et al., 2020](#page-10-0)).

## *2.4. Open reading frames (ORFs) prediction and functional analyses*

The ORFs of the vOTUs were predicted using Prodigal-gv (v2.11.0) with default parameters [\(Camargo et al., 2023; Hyatt et al., 2010](#page-10-0)). Abundance calculations of ORFs were based on the relative abundance of vOTUs in each sample [\(Gu et al., 2021\)](#page-10-0). To further identify the protein domains, viral ORFs were compared with the PfamScan database (evalue *<* 1 × 10-5; bit score *>* 40) using Pfamscan (v1.6) [\(El-Gebali et al.,](#page-10-0)  [2019\)](#page-10-0). The viral protein functional categories were determined by identifying the COGs (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) using eggnogmapper (v2.0.1) ([Huerta-Cepas et al., 2017](#page-11-0)) with default parameters. KEGG Orthology pathways were predicted using KEGG GhostKOAL ([htt](https://www.kegg.jp/ghostkoala/)  [ps://www.kegg.jp/ghostkoala/\)](https://www.kegg.jp/ghostkoala/) ([Kanehisa et al., 2016\)](#page-11-0). Genes associated with the carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus cycles were counted using CAZyme [\(Huang et al., 2018\)](#page-11-0), NCycDB ([Tu et al., 2019](#page-11-0)), SCycDB ([Yu et al., 2020](#page-11-0)); and PCycDB [\(Zeng et al., 2022](#page-11-0)). Finally, DRAM-v (v1.5.0) ([Shaffer et al., 2020\)](#page-11-0) and manual selection (the viral region harbored at least one conserved viral protein or more than 30 % of proteins had the highest similarity to viral proteins according to the annotation) ([Jian et al., 2021\)](#page-11-0) were used to verify the putative auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs).

*2.5. Comparison between the aerosol viral communities and other environmental viral communities*

To compare the eight aerosol viral communities with other environmental viral communities, the IMG/VR v4 database [\(Camargo et al.,](#page-11-0)  [2023\)](#page-11-0), which includes complete or high-quality viral sequences (length *>* 10 k), was searched as well as reference genomes recognized by IMG/ VR. A total of 15,238 viral genomes were retrieved from marine environments (coastal, oceanic, and intertidal zones), 9,963 from soil environments (coastal areas, wetlands, agricultural land, deserts, grasslands, temperate forests, and boreal forests/taiga), and 30 from air environments (outdoor air). For each viral contigs, ORFs were predicted using Prodigal-gv (v2.11.0) [\(Hyatt et al., 2010](#page-10-0)), then all-verses-all DIAMOND (v2.1.9.163) BLASTP was used to compare the protein with parameters: e-value ≤ 10-5, query coverage ≥ 50 %, identity ≥ 25 % ([Gu et al., 2021;](#page-10-0)  [Buchfink et al., 2015\)](#page-10-0). All sequences were analyzed using vConTACT 2 (v 0.11.3) [\(Bin Jang et al., 2019](#page-11-0)) with the following parameters: –db 'None' –pcs-mode MCL –vcs-mode ClusterONE. The resulting network was visualized using Cytoscape (v3.9.1) [\(Shannon et al., 2003\)](#page-11-0), and a number of viral clusters (VCs) were plotted using Evenn [\(https://www.](https://www.ehbio.com/test/venn/%23/)  [ehbio.com/test/venn/#/\)](https://www.ehbio.com/test/venn/%23/). Gene-sharing networks, based on shared protein clusters (PCs) between viral genomes, reveal related genomes as a group of nodes strongly connected through multiple edges—forming a viral cluster (VC). This method has been shown to best represent genuslevel groupings of viral genomes ([Bin Jang et al., 2019\)](#page-11-0), enabling comparisons across ecosystems at a higher taxonomic level ([Ter Horst](#page-11-0)  [et al., 2021\)](#page-11-0).

Seawater samples from China's marginal seas (Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea) were collected from multiple cruises conducted between 2019–2023. Seawater was sequentially filtered through 3.0 µm and 0.2 µm polycarbonate membrane filters (Millipore, MA, USA) to remove micozooplankton, phytoplankton, and bacteria. Planktonic viruses in 20L surface seawater from 9 stations in the Bohai and Yellow seas were enriched using the FeCl3-mediated flocculation method ([Gu](#page-10-0)  [et al., 2021](#page-10-0)) and then stored at 4 ◦C until processing. Planktonic viruses in 150L surface seawater at 8 stations in the East China Sea were concentrated by a two-step tangential flow filtration (TFF) with 50-kDa cartridge (Millipore, MA, USA) to a final volume of 50 mL and then stored at 4 ◦C until processing ([Gao et al., 2022](#page-10-0)). The DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, REF:51304). Then, library construction and high throughput sequencing of the DNA were performed using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (pair-end sequencing, 2 × 150 bp) platform [\(Gao et al., 2022\)](#page-10-0). Quality control, assembly, and identification of viral contigs were performed as described in the previous methods. The vContact2 (v0.11.3) was used to construct a shared network using aerosol samples and seawater samples from the Yellow Sea, Bohai Sea, and the East China Sea, to analyze whether aerosol samples from different sources are more similar to their geographically closer oceanic counterparts.

In addition, metagenomic data of natural aerosol samples from various locations were downloaded from public databases (NCBI and NASA GeneLab) to further compare differences between aerosol virus communities. These included aerosols over the Swedish offshore bays ([Rahlff et al., 2023\)](#page-10-0), dust-associated aerosols above the Red Sea ([Aalismail et al., 2019\)](#page-11-0), and aerosols collected at altitudes from 10,000 ft to 40,000 ft above the Sierra Nevada Mountains ([Jaing et al., 2020](#page-11-0)). Similar methods for quality control, assembly, and identification of viral contigs were performed as described previously.

# *2.6. Generation of host metagenome-assembled genomes and taxonomic profiling of microbial communities*

After the metaSPAdes (v3.13.0) assembly for the eight aerosol samples we collected, contigs were binned (–metabat2 –maxbin2 –concoct) and refined (parameters: − c 70 − x 5) using metaWRAP (v1.3.2) ([Uritskiy et al., 2018; Li et al., 2021](#page-11-0)). A total of 54 bin sets were de-replicated to 39 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) using dRep (v3.2.2) (parameters: − sa 0.95 − comp 70 − con 5) [\(Li et al., 2021;](#page-11-0)  [Olm et al., 2017\)](#page-11-0). The taxonomy of each MAG was initially assigned using GTDB-Tk (v2.4.0) [\(Chaumeil et al., 2019\)](#page-11-0) based on the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) taxonomy 09-RS220 ([Parks et al., 2020](#page-11-0)).

For microbial community analysis, the collected samples were sequenced for 16S rRNA gene amplicons. DNA extraction, PCR reactions, PCR purification, and sequencing procedures were performed as previously described [\(Duan et al., 2021](#page-11-0)). The samples were sequenced by Illumina MiSeq to generate the original sequence data. Subsequently, the adapter sequences were removed, and the cleaned data was imported into QIIME2 (v2023.07) [\(Bolyen et al., 2019](#page-11-0)) for further analyses. Taxonomic identification of the representative sequence for each Amplicon Sequence Variant (ASV) was performed using Featureclassifier ([Bokulich et al., 2018](#page-11-0)) (via q2-feature-classifier) against a Silva database (version 138: [https://www.arb-silva.de/\)](https://www.arb-silva.de/). To enable comparisons between samples, the ASV table was randomly subsampled down to a minimum number of reads per sample (9,269 reads). In addition, 39 marine and 31 terrestrial aerosol samples collected during 2022–2023 were used for microbial diversity analyses.

#### *2.7. Virus*–*host prediction*

Four different host prediction strategies were used to predict the virus-host interactions, including nucleotide sequence homology, oligonucleotide frequency, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) spacer match, and tRNA match, as described in Li et al [\(Li et al., 2021\)](#page-11-0). The microbial MAGs used for virus-host prediction were from the same metagenomes as the viral sequences in this study. These strategies were applied as follows:

(1) Nucleotide Sequence Homology: Sequences of vOTUs were queried against prokaryotic MAGs using BLASTn (query coverage ≥ 75 %, identity ≥ 70 %, bit score ≥ 50, and e-value ≤ 10-5).

(2) oligonucleotide frequency: Oligonucleotide frequency and distance between vOTUs and prokaryotic MAGs were calculated by Vir-HostMatcher (v1.0) ([Ahlgren et al., 2017\)](#page-11-0) with default parameters (d2\* values ≤ 0.2).

(3) CRISPR Spacer Match: CRISPRs are a bacterial immune mechanism that recognizes and memorizes short subsequences from viral invaders [\(Edwards et al., 2016; Barrangou et al., 2007](#page-11-0)). CRISPR spacers are powerful tools for investigating phage-host interactions, as they link phage and host populations within complex microbial communities ([Nasko et al., 2019\)](#page-11-0). In this study, CRISPR arrays were assembled from prokaryotic quality-controlled reads by crass (v1.0.1) ([Skennerton et al.,](#page-11-0)  [2013\)](#page-11-0) and rated by CRISPRcasFinder (v4.3.2) [\(Couvin et al., 2018](#page-11-0)). Those with evidence level 4 (repeat conservation index *>* 70 % and spacer identity *<* 8 %) were retained for subsequent analysis. CRISPR spacers were then compared with viral contigs using BLASTn-short with e-value ≤ 10-5 and mismatch ≤ 1 over the whole spacer. For each matching CRISPR spacer, the corresponding repeat was then compared against the prokaryotic MAGs with the same parameters using BLASTn.

(4) tRNA Match: The tRNAs from the vOTU and prokaryotic MAG sequences were identified using ARAGORN (v1.2.38) with the '-t' option ([Laslett and Canback, 2004\)](#page-11-0), with match requirements of ≥ 90 % length with identity ≥ 90 % of the sequences by BLASTn ([Coutinho et al.,](#page-10-0)  [2017\)](#page-10-0).

## *2.8. Analysis of complete and high-quality viral genomes and phylogenetic analysis*

The completeness of the vOTUs was assessed using CheckV (v1.0.1) ([Nayfach et al., 2021\)](#page-10-0), and the selected complete and high-quality viral genomes were then matched against the NCBI database using online BLASTn. Given that 11 sequences of the *Genomoviridae* family were found in the complete or high-quality data, an in-depth analysis of the viruses of this taxon followed. The *Genomoviridae* family includes viruses with small (~2–2.4 kb), circular ssDNA genomes encoding two key proteins: the rolling-circle replication initiation proteins (Rep) and the unique capsid proteins (CP). In 2017, a sequence-based taxonomic framework was established for genomovirus classification, setting a genome-wide pairwise identity threshold of 78 % for species demarcation, whereas Rep sequence phylogeny was used to define genera ([Varsani and Krupovic, 2017\)](#page-11-0). From the NCBI Virus database, complete RefSeq proteins (278) belonging to the *Genomoviridae* family were downloaded. PfamScan (v1.6) [\(El-Gebali et al., 2019\)](#page-10-0) was then used to identify rep proteins containing the Rep catalytic domain (Gemini\_AL1; PF00799) and Rep protein central domain (Gemini\_AL1\_M; PF08283) from the aerosol viral communities sequences and the downloaded sequences ([Krupovic et al., 2016](#page-11-0)). An alignment of selected *Genomoviridae*  rep proteins along with reviewed Geminivirus Rep catalytic domain PF00799 sequences (50) from the InterPro database was created using MUSCLE 5 (v5.1) [\(Edgar, 2022](#page-11-0)) and trimmed to remove positions with gaps over 90 % using trimAL (v1.4.1) [\(Capella-Gutierrez et al., 2009](#page-11-0)). A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was produced using IQ-TREE (v2.2.0.3) ([Nguyen et al., 2015\)](#page-11-0), and the resulting phylogenetic tree was visualized with iTOL v6 (<https://itol.embl.de/>) ([Letunic and Bork,](#page-11-0)  [2021\)](#page-11-0). The average nucleotide identity between sequences was calculated using VIRIDIC (v1.1) ([https://rhea.icbm.uni-oldenburg.de](https://rhea.icbm.uni-oldenburg.de/VIRIDIC/)  [/VIRIDIC/](https://rhea.icbm.uni-oldenburg.de/VIRIDIC/)) ([Moraru et al., 2020](#page-11-0)).

For *Caudoviricetes*, four conserved domains (Terminase\_1, Terminase\_3, Terminase\_6N, Terminase\_Gpa) were searched in the ORFs of the aerosol viral communities using PfamScan (v1.6). The identified sequences were then dereplicated [\(Gu et al., 2021](#page-10-0)). Reference sequences containing at least one of the four conserved domains were downloaded from the NCBI Virus database and dereplicated. Sequences with less than 300 amino acids were filtered out. The combined aerosol viral community sequences and downloaded sequences were used to construct a phylogenetic tree as described above.

#### *2.9. Statistical analysis*

The α- and β-diversity indexes were calculated using vegan (2.6–6.1) in R (v 4.4.1) based on the relative abundances of vOTUs ([Oksanen et al.,](#page-11-0)  <span id="page-4-0"></span>[2013\)](#page-11-0). Significance analyses of viral diversity, lifestyle, relative abundance of family level annotations, AMGs, COG classifications, and host diversity between land and sea aerosol sample were performed using independent sample *t*-tests with the statistical software SPSS (v25).

#### **3. Results and Discussions**

#### *3.1. Distinctness of the airborne viral communities*

Viruses and bacteria are capable of attaching to aerosol particles, as evidenced by confocal microscopy (Fig. S1). The frequent association of airborne viruses with suspended particles, rather than existing individually, has also been demonstrated in previous studies [\(Aller et al., 2005;](#page-10-0)  [Yang et al., 2011](#page-10-0)). Network analyses, based on shared protein content of viruses from different habitats reveal that, although the largest VC contained viral sequences prevalent in all three habitats, each habitat also hosted a viral community distinct from the other ecosystems (Fig. 2a). Of the 94 VCs detected in aerosol samples, 70.2 % (66 VCs) were exclusively found within the aerosol viral communities and were not present in the other habitats (Fig. 2b).

A comparison of aerosol samples from different locations revealed that aerosol viruses are strongly influenced by altitudes and their sources [\(Fig. 3](#page-5-0)a, Table S2). Aerosol viruses from low altitudes across different locations show more similarity compared to those from high altitudes (10,000 ft to 40,000 ft). Among the low-altitude natural aerosol samples, those over the East China Sea showed closer similarities to aerosol samples collected at the Swedish seaside, while aerosol viruses over East Asian lands exhibited greater resemblance to aerosols originating from the Sahara dust [\(Fig. 3](#page-5-0)b).

The viral sequences identified in the aerosol viral communities were predominantly from the *Caudoviricetes* class. A phylogenetic tree constructed using the terminase large subunit identified the presence of 66 phage terminase sequences (Fig. S2, Table S3). These putative phage

terminases exhibited a wide distribution across the evolutionary tree, indicating a high diversity of *Caudoviricetes* associated with the aerosols. Notably, many viral clades consisting of terminase sequences were exclusively detected in these aerosol viral communities, suggesting the possible existence of distinct aerosol *Caudoviricetes* taxa.

The distinct viral community in aerosols can be attributed to rapid fluctuations over short periods in environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and liquid water content in the atmosphere [\(Santl-](#page-10-0)[Temkiv et al., 2022\)](#page-10-0). These fluctuations expose cells to repeated thermal and UV shocks, potentially driving microbial diversity and adaptation within aerosol environments. Distinct bacterial community structures have been reported in the atmosphere, with bacterial taxa adapted to survive under high ultraviolet (UV) irradiance, moisture limitations, and other challenges being overrepresented ([Santl-Temkiv et al., 2022;](#page-10-0)  [Tignat-Perrier et al., 2019](#page-10-0)). This indicates a robust environmental filtering process. As obligate parasites rely entirely on hosts for reproduction and survival, viruses may undergo similar dynamics to those of other environments, akin to bacteria.

It is worth noting that three shared VCs were identified across all habitats, all belonging to *Caudoviricetes*. One of these was a P2-like phage, while the other two were unclassified below the class level (Fig. 2c). These phages are capable of switching between lytic and lysogenic modes ([Nilsson and Haggard-Ljungquist, 2007](#page-11-0)) and exhibit the capacity to infect a range of Gammaproteobacteria [\(Nilsson and](#page-11-0)  [Haggard-Ljungquist, 2007; Bertani and Bertani, 1971](#page-11-0)). Their genomes are highly stable, and they can indirectly increase their own fitness by improving the fitness of the host upon lysogenization ([Nilsson and](#page-11-0)  [Haggard-Ljungquist, 2007\)](#page-11-0), thereby enabling their existence in diverse habitats.

ecosystems produced interesting results with regard to their habitatdependent characteristics. In the land aerosol samples, a total of 708 vOTUs were identified, while in the ocean aerosol samples, only 163 vOTUs were found. There were significant differences in diversity and community composition at the vOTU level, with pristine marine airborne vOTUs exhibiting lower richness and Shannon diversity index compared to those from land aerosols ([Fig. 4](#page-6-0)a, Table S4). The prokaryotic richness and Shannon diversity index, derived from 16S rRNA gene sequencing of 31 land aerosol samples and 39 ocean aerosol samples collected from the same locations as this study, exhibited a consistent pattern (Fig. S3, Table S4 & S5). This observation aligns with previous studies suggesting that environmental filtering, i.e., the restrictiveness of the environment, regulates bacterial diversity ([Adams](#page-11-0)  [et al., 2015\)](#page-11-0), thereby influencing the diversity of phages with narrow host ranges (Lopez-Leal ´ [et al., 2022](#page-11-0)). In oceanic environments with more restrictive living conditions, environmental filtering tends to be stronger, resulting in a lower diversity of viruses. In contrast, in areas more heavily influenced by human activities, the concentration of bacteria in aerosols was observed to rise (urban areas vs. rural regions, heavy vehicular traffic area vs. quieter regions) [\(Harrison et al., 2005;](#page-11-0)  [Burrows et al., 2009; Fang et al., 2007\)](#page-11-0). In such environments, the influence of environmental filtering in shaping bacterial communities is reduced, while stochastic processes play a more dominant role in shaping the community [\(Zhao et al., 2022](#page-11-0)). This leads to greater diversity and richness of airborne viruses. Similar patterns have also been

reported in the indoor environment, with lower viral diversity in the air of subways equipped with advanced ventilation and filtration systems than in venues relying on natural ventilation [\(Prussin et al., 2019\)](#page-11-0).

The closer associations observed in beta diversity among samples from the same habitat (as shown in NMDS analysis, [Fig. 4](#page-6-0)b), along with the variation in dominant viruses among different habitats [\(Fig. 4c](#page-6-0), Table S4), both reflect the influence of habitat on shaping aerosol viral community composition. However, it should be noted that significant differences in the relative abundance of different vOTUs within each sample persisted from the same habitat, underscoring the dynamic nature of viruses in the atmosphere (Fig. S4).

At the VC level, most clusters specific to terrestrial aerosols were identified as *Caudoviricetes* and unknown taxa (Fig. S5). Another 3 VCs belonged to the *Genomoviridae* family of ssDNA. Among marine aerosolspecific VCs, 11 (92 %) were categorized as *Caudoviricetes*, including one VCs belonging to the P2-like phages. Furthermore, 28 VCs, comprising 70 % of marine aerosols and 47 % of terrestrial aerosols, were shared between the two habitats excluding the remaining reference sequences (Fig. S6). Among these, 14 (50 %) VCs were classified as *Caudoviricetes*, and others lacked annotation information. These shared VCs between marine and terrestrial aerosols could be due to the dispersion processes across different environments driven by the air circulation patterns and meteorological conditions (e.g. wind speed and direction).

Although the air ecosystem is characterized by its fluidity, allowing for long-range transport and dynamic processes, a deeper understanding

is needed to determine the degree of connectivity between the viral community and adjacent environments. Therefore, comparisons of viral communities between the aerosol environment and neighboring marine or soil habitats were conducted. Specifically, land aerosols exhibited a greater percentage of VCs shared with soil habitats (21.6 %) compared to the ocean (13.5 %), whereas marine aerosols showed a larger proportion of VCs shared with the ocean (25.6 %) than with soil (14 %) ([Fig. 2c](#page-4-0)). Moreover, marine aerosols collected over the East China Sea share higher percentages of VCs with the East China Sea than with other seas (17.4 % vs. 10.9 %) (Fig. S5). These observations support that certain airborne viruses are capable of being transported from their local environmental sources. Previous studies have found that up to 2 billion tonnes of desert dust is transported into the atmosphere annually ([Shepherd et al., 2016](#page-11-0)), potentially carrying viruses from the soil ([Gonzalez-Martin et al., 2014](#page-11-0)). Alternatively, marine aerosols are primarily formed by the eruption of bubbles rising through the sea-surface microlayer (SML) [\(Aller et al., 2005](#page-10-0)), facilitating the transportation of microorganisms such as viruses from the ocean to the atmosphere. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the vast majority of the viruses were specific to aerosols or had an unclear origin of dispersal in our study.

A total of 78 vOTUs were predicted to have corresponding hosts, comprising a relative abundance of 26.2 % (Fig. 4d). Among these, 42.2 % of the vOTUs from marine-sourced aerosols were assigned to hosts, while this percentage significantly dropped to 10.1 % for vOTUs from land sources. Coincident with the observed distinct viral community composition in the two habitats, the predicted hosts also demonstrate clear habitat differences. The predicted prokaryotic hosts for marinesourced aerosol viruses encompassed four bacterial class-level taxa belonging to three phyla, with Gammaproteobacteria (60 % of virushost pairs) and Alphaproteobacteria (20 %) being the most frequently predicted. In contrast, the predicted prokaryotic hosts of land-sourced aerosol viruses included six bacterial class-level taxa belonging to four phyla, with Actinomycetes (46.2 %) and Gammaproteobacteria (33.3 %), accounting for 79.5 % of the vOTUs predicted to have hosts. The predicted relative abundance of host-associated vOTUs is consistent with the bacterial relative abundance obtained through 16S rRNA gene analysis (Fig. 4e). For instance, bacteria belonging to the Pseudomonadota phylum were more prevalent in marine aerosols, along with their associated viruses, compared to land samples. This pattern may be influenced by the high occurrence of Gammaproteobacteria in the surface microlayer, which facilitates their transfer into the atmosphere ([Stolle et al., 2011](#page-11-0)). The habitat-specific patterns evident in the viralhost community further emphasize the significant influence of specific features within each habitat that shape interactions between viruses and their hosts.

### *3.3. Airborne Viruses: Pathogens and beyond*

The interest in airborne viruses stems from their potential to cause diseases ([Lai et al., 2009; Leung, 2021](#page-10-0)), while some can also be beneficial to human health and the environment ([Ariya et al., 2009; Barr](#page-11-0)  [et al., 2013\)](#page-11-0). There is evidence that many common infections are caused by viruses, such as measles virus, influenza virus, norovirus, enterovirus, coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, varicella-zoster virus, and adenovirus, which can be transmitted through the air [\(Al-Rubaey et al.,](#page-11-0)  [2022\)](#page-11-0). In this dataset focusing on DNA viruses, fragments of herpesviruses were detected in the aerosols ([Fig. 4](#page-6-0)c). Herpesviruses have a broad host range and can infect humans and other vertebrates. The relative abundance of *Orthoherpesviridae,* which contains 25 herpesviruses fragments, was significantly higher in land-sourced aerosol samples than in ocean-sourced samples (Fig. S7). It is worth noting that, although the land samples were collected from the summit of a small mountain in Qingdao, distant from human activities and near a government air quality monitoring station, human activity can still influence the composition of viral communities in aerosols.

Members of the *Inoviridae* family were detected in the dataset, with a higher relative abundance on land compared to the ocean ([Fig. 4c](#page-6-0)). Filamentous bacteriophages from the *Inoviridae* family infect a number of gram-negative, and some gram-positive, bacteria, such as *Vibrio cholerae*, *Yersinia pestis*, *Neisseria meningitides*, *Pseudomonas aruginosa*, and some plant pathogens ([Ilyina, 2015](#page-11-0)). Some Inoviruses can encode and express the major virulence factor of toxigenic *Vibrio cholerae*, and can indirectly affect pathogenicity by altering biofilm formation and host colonization abilities [\(Roux et al., 2019\)](#page-12-0). In our dataset, Zonula occludens toxin (*Zot*) (Ocean3\_366\_ORF1, Ocean3\_460\_ORF2, Land4\_5924\_ORF1), an enterotoxin produced by *Vibrio cholerae* and carried by Inoviruses, was detected. The *zot* gene has the ability to reversibly alter intestinal epithelial tight junctions, allowing macromolecules to pass through the mucosal barrier. Along with other genes encoding virulence factors (e.g., *ctxA*, *ctxB*, and *ace*), *zot* plays a synergistic role in the development of acute dehydrating diarrhea typical of cholera [\(Fasano et al., 1995](#page-12-0)).

In addition, our dataset identified viruses from the *Iridoviridae* family, which infect invertebrates and poikilothermic vertebrates, including amphibians, reptiles, and fish [\(Fig. 4](#page-6-0)c) ([Williams, 1996](#page-12-0)). Iridovirus infections range from subclinical to severe and may lead to significant mortality ([Ahne et al., 1989; Hedrick and McDowell, 1995; Hedrick](#page-12-0)  [et al., 1992; Langdon et al., 1986; Pozet et al., 1992\)](#page-12-0). These infections have also been implicated in declines in amphibian populations and are considered emerging infectious diseases whose spread has been accelerated by human activities [\(Bollinger et al., 1999; Jancovich et al., 2001;](#page-12-0)  [Daszak et al., 2003; Jancovich et al., 2005\)](#page-12-0).

A total of 66 complete and high-quality viral sequences were obtained from the eight viral metagenomes. Eleven sequences were found to be related to viruses that infect pathogenic bacteria associated with humans, animals, and plants and were detected in both land and marine aerosols (Table S6, Fig. S8). These bacterial pathogens can cause human diarrhea, septicemia, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, meningitis, and other illnesses ([Knodler and Elfenbein, 2019; Wyres et al., 2020](#page-12-0)). A soil-borne bacterial plant pathogen, *Ralstonia solanacearum*, was also identified ([Genin and Denny, 2012](#page-12-0)). The presence of these viruses with complete genomes suggests the potential of these airborne viruses to cause infections and thus influence the dynamics of bacterial infections in humans, plants, and animals. Furthermore, through host prediction, we identified that at the genus level, more than half of the viral hosts are pathogenic bacteria, including *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Klebsiella pneumoniae* from the ESKAPE (six highly virulent and antibioticresistant bacterial pathogens of urgent concern to the World Health Organization) (Fig. S9) ([Tacconelli, 2017\)](#page-12-0). Host predictions also included *Staphylococcus gallinarum*, a relative of *Staphylococcus aureus*, as well as *Acinetobacter nosocomialis*, related to *Acinetobacter baumannii*—all of which pose significant health risks to humans. Studies

have found that bacteria tend to maintain cultivability more effectively when attached to larger particles, attributed to the protective shielding provided by these particles against environmental stresses [\(Burrows](#page-11-0)  [et al., 2009; Lighthart, 2000](#page-11-0)). Similar protective advantages may extend to viruses, potentially facilitating their infection of hosts under favorable conditions [\(Aller et al., 2005](#page-10-0)). However, further research is necessary to fully understand their pathogenicity and explore the extent of this influence and its implications.

Interestingly, the presence of a marker gene encoding rolling-circle replication initiation protein (Rep) from the ssDNA *Genomoviridae* was identified in the other 11 viral genomes (Table S6). This Rep protein shares two conserved domains with proteins found in members of the *Geminiviridae* family. The phylogenetic tree constructed using Rep gene sequences has distinct clusters of viral groups within *Genomoviridae* and *Geminiviridae*, which form separate sister groups ([Fig. 5a](#page-8-0), Table S7). Within *Genomoviridae*, distinct branches were observed for different genera, with 11 novel viruses affiliated with various genera [\(Fig. 5b](#page-8-0)), contributing to the understanding of the diversity and taxonomy of uncultured ssDNA viruses within the *Genomoviridae* family. Studies have shown that certain members of the *Genomoviridae* family can infect fungi ([Li et al., 2020\)](#page-12-0). The 11 sequences of *Genomoviridae* are predominantly present in terrestrial aerosols, originating from diverse sources such as the feces of egrets and giant pandas, the serum of Sus scrofa domesticus, as well as wastewater metagenomes and the dryland aerobiome (Fig. S8; Table S6).

## *3.4. Environmental conditions shaping viral Lifestyles and functional gene Profiles*

The different environments present in land and ocean clearly create the distinctive ecological conditions that drive the selection and adaptation of aerosol viruses. Upon invading a host, viruses can apply different strategies to enhance their chances of survival or drive host adaptation ([Coclet and Roux, 2021](#page-12-0)).

One such mechanism is the insertion of large DNA fragments into the bacterial chromosome by phages with lysogenic cycles ([Bobay et al.,](#page-12-0)  [2013\)](#page-12-0). This generates genetic variation and evolutionary innovation to help the host adapt to new environments ([Du et al., 2023](#page-10-0)). The relative abundance of lysogenic viruses in the ocean aerosol samples was significantly higher than in the land aerosol samples (Fig. S10;Table S4; *t*-test, *p <* 0.05). It is likely that harsh environmental conditions over the oceans, such as high UV radiation levels due to fewer air pollutants and sand activity [\(Elminir, 2007\)](#page-12-0) and limited nutrition due to low industrial emissions [\(Gruber and Galloway, 2008; Falkowski et al., 2000; Maho](#page-12-0)[wald et al., 2008](#page-12-0)), may contribute to the selection of a lysogenic lifestyle ([Jiang and Paul, 1998](#page-12-0)). Lysogeny may serve as a strategy for viruses to evade degradation, ensuring their survival and accumulating genetic variation under non-selective conditions. The presence of lysogenic phages also contributes to the immune response of host cells against homologous phage infection ([Du et al., 2023; Bobay et al., 2013\)](#page-10-0). The detection of more viruses belonging to the *Peduoviridae* family in the ocean aerosol samples compared with the land aerosol samples [\(Fig. 4c](#page-6-0)) suggests that these viruses, including P2-like viruses capable of entering a lysogenic state, may be better adapted to these environments ([Nilsson](#page-11-0)  [and Haggard-Ljungquist, 2007; Turner et al., 2023](#page-11-0)).

In addition to lysogenic infection, another strategy to drive host adaptation involves the expression of viral auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) encoded by the phage but originating from the host cells. These AMGs allow the phage to fine-tune the host's metabolic processes in a way that optimally supports its own life cycle ([Coutinho et al., 2017](#page-10-0)). In this study, a number of categories of AMGs associated with carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and lipid metabolism were detected in the aerosol viral communities. These AMGs displayed environmental variability, potentially related to resource availability, indicating their role in adapting to different environmental conditions [\(Fig. 6a](#page-9-0), Table S4). Of the AMGs, carbohydrate-active genes and lipid metabolism genes had

the highest diversity. Genes specifically involved in the nitrogen cycle, such as *gdh*, which is associated with organic nitrogen degradation and synthesis pathways, were detected. This result is consistent with the observed high content of organic nitrogen present in the anthropogenic aerosols in East Asia [\(Mahowald et al., 2017](#page-12-0)) and suggests an advantage for bacterial hosts capable of degrading organic nitrogen ([Chubukov](#page-12-0)  [et al., 2014; Guldberg et al., 2002\)](#page-12-0). The phosphate regulon (*phoH*), which regulates phosphate uptake and metabolism under lowphosphate conditions, exhibited a higher relative abundance in aerosol samples above the ocean, where atmospheric phosphorus (P) load is considerably lower compared to those over continental areas. It has been reported that approximately 90 % of the total atmospheric burden of P is found over continents, primarily sourced from soil particles containing both naturally occurring and fertilizer-derived P [\(Graham and Duce,](#page-12-0)  [1979\)](#page-12-0). The expression of *phoH* genes has been shown to significantly increase as phosphorus concentration decreases [\(Gao et al., 2022](#page-12-0)). Therefore, the presence of *phoH* genes in ocean aerosols may assist host in overcoming limitations in phosphorus metabolism by regulating specific steps in these metabolic pathways. Other AMGs related to phosphorus metabolism (*rpiA*, *ptsH*) were also detected, indicating viral involvement in atmospheric phosphorus cycling.

While a significant number of viral proteins involved in replication, recombination, and repair were successfully identified and annotated, a considerable proportion of viral proteins still remain functionally uncharacterized. Proteins related to cell motility showed significantly higher relative abundance in the aerosol viral communities from ocean sources than those from land sources. In contrast, viruses from land sources displayed a significantly higher relative abundance of proteins associated with energy production and conversion and inorganic ion transport and metabolism (Fig. 6b, Table S4). These differences in functional gene abundance reflect the specific adaptive strategies of viruses in response to their respective habitats, highlighting the distinctive ecological conditions that drive viral-host interactions in different environments. However, we should note that this study is only based on DNA sequencing-based methods, and further validation is needed for functional genes as well as pathogens.

Our results uncovered a distinct ecological zone occupied by airborne viral communities, which was separate from marine and soil ones. Besides aerosol-specific viruses, aerosol viruses can also be transported from nearby soil or marine environments via atmospheric circulation, comprising the whole community. Significant differences in airborne viral diversity, community composition, functional gene profile, and lifestyle were observed between environments over land and ocean. Notably, our dataset also detected the presence of pathogenic viruses associated with human diseases, particularly in aerosols collected from terrestrial environments. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding the characteristics and dynamics of viral communities in the air and their potential implications for human health.
