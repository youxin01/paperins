# ABSTRACT

*Objective:* To provide guidance for the use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Evidence-to-Decision (EtD) framework for environmental and occupational health (EOH). *Study design and setting:* We conducted a systematic review and narrative synthesis of published and public EOH decision frameworks, followed by a modified Delphi process leading to development of a draft GRADE EtD framework for EOH. We pilot tested the provisional framework through a virtual workshop series, which further informed guidance for the framework's application. We presented a summary of the results to all attendees of the GRADE Working Group meeting for feedback in July 2022 and November 2022, and for approval in May 2023. *Results:* Consistent with existing GRADE EtD frameworks, the EtD framework for EOH includes a scoping and contextualization process and twelve assessment criteria. Modifications to the existing EtD frameworks include: consideration of the socio-political context when making judgments about the priority of the problem and feasibility of different alternatives; the addition of timing when making judgments about benefits and harms, the balance of effects, and feasibility; broadening of the equity criterion to include considerations beyond health equity; and more explicit accommodation of variable or conflicting stakeholder views when considering values and acceptability. The new EtD framework is also accompanied by a user guide intended to support its implementation in the EOH context.

*Conclusion:* Policymakers, regulators, and other stakeholders may use this GRADE EtD framework to approach decision-making about environmental and occupational exposures and interventions.

What is new? **Key findings**

- The GRADE EtD framework accommodates relevant concepts for decision-making in environmental and occupational health (EOH).
- Limited uptake of the GRADE EtD framework in EOH may be attributed to factors other than incompatibility of the EtD framework with EOH decision-making approaches.
- Guidance for users is essential to support the framework's implementation in EOH.

# **What this adds to what was known**

- There are currently six GRADE EtD frameworks for different types of decisions: individual- and population-level clinical recommendations, health system and public health recommendations, coverage decisions, individual- and population-level diagnostic test recommendations.
- This project introduces a seventh framework that is tailored for environmental and occupational health (EOH) decisions.

#### **What are the implications and what should change?**

• Policymakers, regulators, and other decision-makers should consider adopting the GRADE EtD for EOH to enhance consistency, transparency, and stakeholder trust in EOH decisions, including recommendations or regulations.

# **1. Background**

Systematic review (SR) methods are increasingly used to provide comprehensive and rigorous evidence on the health impacts of environmental and occupational (EOH) exposures ([Woodruff](#page-11-0) and Sutton, 2014; [Hoffmann](#page-11-0) et al., 2022; Rooney et al., 2014; Whaley and Roth, 2022; Wolffe et al., 2019; [Morgan](#page-11-0) et al., 2016; Radke et al., 2020; Pega et al., [2022\)](#page-11-0). However, the results of SRs often highlight uncertainty in the available evidence, which presents a challenge to translating systematic review findings into clear policy recommendations. Additionally, values, baseline conditions, and susceptibility to harms may be variable both across and within affected populations. Furthermore, decision-makers must often balance societal, economic, and political considerations, complicating the direct application of scientific evidence in policymaking. Addressing the integration of SR findings with additional considerations is crucial to enhancing the credibility, transparency, and consistency of decisions, ensuring that evidence is meaningfully integrated into EOH guidelines.

GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) evidence-to-decision (EtD) frameworks support decision-makers in developing recommendations that are based on informed, transparent judgements about the potential consequences of different options ([Alonso-Coello](#page-10-0) et al., 2016). These frameworks facilitate consideration of potential desirable and undesirable health effects (benefits and harms), while also systematically taking into account values, resource use, equity, acceptability, and feasibility of different alternatives [\(Alonso-Coello](#page-10-0) et al., 2016; Andrews et al., 2013; Andrews et al., [2013](#page-10-0)). The intended result is an evidence-informed recommendation or decision that can be fully explained to stakeholders. The GRADE EtD frameworks, introduced in 2016, address six types of decisions: individual- and population-level clinical recommendations, health system and public health recommendations, coverage decisions, individual- and population-level diagnostic test recommendations ([Alonso-Coello](#page-10-0) et al., 2016; Morgan et al., 2018; Parmelli et al., 2017; Moberg et al., 2018; [Schünemann](#page-10-0) et al., 2016; Mustafa et al., 2017; Evidence to Decision (EtD) [framework|DECIDE,](#page-10-0) 2011).

A clear and consistent approach is essential for making decisions

about EOH policy interventions, such as selecting exposure thresholds, or recommending appropriate personal protective equipment [\(Woodruff](#page-11-0) and Sutton, 2014; Rooney et al., 2014; [Grandjean](#page-11-0) and Ozonoff, 2013; [Hart,](#page-11-0) 2020). These decisions impact broad and diverse groups of stakeholders (e.g., local communities, business owners, political figures) with serious consequences, yet they are often based on very uncertain evidence [\(Morgan](#page-10-0) et al., 2016; Morgan et al., 2018; Morgan et al., 2019). There is no prevailing approach to integrating evidence, such as the output of a hazard identification or risk characterization process, with additional decision factors in EOH ([Senerth](#page-10-0) et al., 2025). Through a systematic literature review of and a modified Delphi study, we identified a patchwork of decision frameworks that have been developed for specific scenarios with limited generalizability beyond their niche ([Senerth](#page-10-0) et al., 2025). For example, a framework for making decisions about decommissioning oil and gas platforms is not applicable to a chemical alternatives assessment, despite some conceptual overlap (consideration of feasibility, cost, and ecological impact) [\(Malloy](#page-10-0) et al., 2013; [Bernstein,](#page-10-0) 2015). We propose that the GRADE EtD framework may add value to the formulation of EOH decisions by facilitating a standardized and transparent decision-making process across many different types of decisions [\(Neumann](#page-10-0) et al., 2016; Z¨ ahringer et al., 2020; [Meneses-Echavez](#page-10-0) et al., 2023). This guidance aims to introduce a new GRADE EtD framework that has been developed to bridge gaps between decision-making approaches in EOH and the existing GRADE EtD framework.

# **2. Methods**

We adopted an inductive approach to identify considerations that are useful to inform EOH decision-making, building on the deductive approach used to develop the GRADE EtD framework ([Moberg](#page-10-0) et al., [2018\)](#page-10-0). We then followed an iterative process to refine a comprehensive list of decision considerations into an organized and well-defined framework. First, we conducted a systematic review and narrative synthesis of published and public EOH decision frameworks; second, an expert panel rated the considerations identified from the literature through a modified Delphi process ([Senerth](#page-10-0) et al., 2025). Finally, we conducted a workshop series to pilot test the provisional GRADE EtD framework for EOH with an example decision scenario, which further informed guidance for the framework's application.

## *2.1. Stage 1: Systematic review & narrative synthesis*

# *2.1.1. Protocol and search strategy*

The systematic review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022316686) and reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) standards (Page et al., 2021; Emily [Senerth](#page-10-0) et al., 2024). Detailed methods and results from the review are reported separately. In brief, the search strategy was developed in consultation with an experienced health sciences librarian and translated into the following databases: MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. The search was restricted to materials published in English within 10 years prior to the starting date of the review (September 26, 2021) to capture frameworks published both before and after publication of the GRADE EtD that are plausibly still in use. Additionally, we conducted a manual search of gray literature, including websites of government, professional, and public health organizations that produce health guidelines and the federal register.

# *2.1.2. Study selection*

We included primary studies or systematic reviews of frameworks, tools, or templates for making decisions or formulating recommendations, or for priority-setting of interventions or exposures in public health. By employing an inclusive selection strategy, we aimed to identify a comprehensive set of frameworks within the subset of environmental and occupational health. We excluded sources that: did not have relevance to EOH decision-making, evaluated the effectiveness of specific EOH interventions, did not describe a decision-making framework, or described a framework that is focused exclusively on economic analysis, certainty of evidence assessment, risk assessment, or hazard identification. If multiple documents reported on the same framework, exact duplicates were excluded and duplicated reports of the same framework were only included once. Two reviewers independently screened each title, abstract, and full text in duplicate. At all stages of the review, disagreements were resolved through discussion or by consulting a third reviewer.

#### *2.1.3. Data management and abstraction*

Search results were exported to Covidence (Covidence systematic review software, Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia. Available at [www.covidence.org](http://www.covidence.org/)) to remove duplicates, screen sources, and document reasons for exclusion at the full-text stage. We used Google Forms to develop and pilot a standardized abstraction tool. If any data items were missing from or ambiguous in the published (or public) framework, we abstracted and analyzed the available information at face value, making as few assumptions as possible about the intent of the framework developer. Abstraction was performed by one researcher and reviewed by a second. We did not perform a quality appraisal of the frameworks, as this review was concerned with identifying all relevant criteria for EOH decision-making irrespective of the quality of the studies in which they are reported.

# *2.1.4. Analysis plan*

We conducted a narrative analysis using textual descriptions and tabulation to systematically describe the characteristics of the included frameworks. For the individual decision considerations abstracted from the included frameworks, we designed a coding strategy to map abstracted considerations onto the criteria presented in the GRADE EtD framework for health system and public health decisions. This allowed us to identify: (a) the existence of an EOH decision framework that would make development of a new GRADE EtD framework redundant, (b) any concepts from EOH decision-making that are not part of the GRADE EtD framework, thereby necessitating its extension, and (c) any considerations within the EOH decision frameworks that could inform adaptation of the GRADE EtD framework to improve its applicability to EOH.

### *2.2. Stage 2: Modified Delphi study*

The set of decision considerations resulting from the systematic review and narrative synthesis was presented to a panel of stakeholders (content experts and target users of the EtD framework), who were asked to identify any factors in EOH decision-making that were not discovered in the published or gray literature. Additionally, panelists were instructed to recommend reorganization, consolidation, and rewording of the decision considerations as the basis for development of an integrated decision framework that will be applicable to EOH. This Delphi study was conducted and reported according to published guidance; detailed methods and results are reported separately [\(Senerth](#page-10-0) et al., 2025; Hasson et al., 2000; Grime et al., [2016;Jüngeretal.,](#page-10-0) 2017;Turoff, [2002\)](#page-10-0).

#### *2.2.1. Stakeholder panel*

Stakeholders were recruited by the research team based on a matrix describing characteristics of anticipated users of an EOH decision framework and consumers of EOH recommendations. We aimed to recruit between 15 and 25 total panelists comprising target users of the GRADE EtD framework for EOH, participants with expertise in GRADE methods, and participants with expertise in several subspecialties of environmental and occupational health. The panel was appointed after ensuring consent to participate and balanced representation across gender, geographical settings, institutional contexts, and topical expertise. Prior to convening the panel, we collected information on intellectual and financial relationships from participants and did not identify any conflicts that would necessitate recusal for any portions of the process.

# *2.2.2. Study procedures*

Panelists received instructions and survey materials via email; the survey was developed and fielded in Excel (Version 16.67; Microsoft, 2022). Panelists rated decision considerations that were abstracted and consolidated from the systematic review and narrative synthesis, along with criteria and detailed judgements from the GRADE EtD framework as presented in GRADEpro [\(gdt.gradepro.org\)](http://gdt.gradepro.org) on a 7-point Likert scale. The questionnaire also included multiple opportunities for free text comments: suggestions for revision of the wording, requests for additional guidance, other comments on the considerations, and addition of any new considerations. Questionnaires were completed independently, and panelists were not provided with any information about how others had voted in the prior round. The first round of the Delphi exercise began in March 2022 and lasted 14 days; the second round began in June 2022 and used a modified questionnaire based on iterative feedback and consensus during Round 1; this round also lasted 14 days.

# *2.2.3. Analysis plan*

Survey responses were anonymized by one member of the research team (ES) and processed by three members of the research team (RLM, PW, ES) during a series of virtual meetings. The primary outcome was attainment of panel consensus on the inclusion and wording of each consideration. Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Items that received a median rating of *>* 6.9 out of 7 automatically advanced to the next round; items that received a median rating of *<* 4.9 were removed. Items with median scores in between these values and/or items demonstrating large variability in rating (i.e., IQR *>* 2) were discussed during the consensus meetings, including qualitative analysis of free text comments. These were coded into four categories: "scope (wording should be more specific to environmental health), redundancy (addressed within or duplicated by another item), new (new decision consideration proposed by the respondent), and clarity (the content of the item is unclear to the respondent). Panel ratings and feedback from the second round informed organization of the decision considerations into a decision framework.

### *2.3. Stage 3: Pilot workshop series*

We subjected the provisional GRADE EtD framework for EOH to a series of pilot tests to investigate its capability to accommodate an example EOH decision scenario, and to identify potential barriers to framework implementation in a real-world setting.

#### *2.3.1. Workshop participants*

Subject matter experts were recruited by the research team, with a focus on outreach to anticipated users of an EOH decision framework and those with experience in EOH decision-making. The first workshop was advertised to the GRADE environmental health project group (n = 82). Additional prospective participants (n = 29) were recruited via social media (Twitter, LinkedIn) and personal emails from the research team detailing the objectives, anticipated process, and timeline. We placed no limit on the number of participants. The first workshop had 18 participants from the GRADE EH project group and the second workshop had three participants from the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

# *2.3.2. Workshop structure*

We conducted two virtual workshops of two hours duration with separate participant groups. The virtual format was selected to be most inclusive of diverse geographic regions and to facilitate recording. Regardless of their current role, participants were instructed to approach the EtD framework from the perspective of decision-makers when providing feedback. They were also advised about the objective of the workshop, provided with background information on the project, and presented with an abbreviated GRADE evidence profile describing the health benefits and harms of the proposed intervention. For the purposes of this exercise, participants were asked to assume that the evidence profile was accurate and comprehensive. After this introduction, participants worked through each of the assessment criteria of the GRADE EtD framework for EOH facilitated by three members of the research team (ES, RLM, PW). These workshops did not include pilot testing of the EtD framework scope and context criteria due to constraints on participants' availability.

#### *2.3.3. Example decision scenario*

The research team developed a hypothetical EOH decision scenario so that an accelerated decision-making process would be feasible during a single two-hour workshop. The question presented to workshop participants was: "As a regional government health agency serving Fayette County, West Virginia, USA (Appalachia), you are tasked with providing a recommendation between two options: should a local coal mine be closed or continue to operate as usual?" (Supplement 1).

# *2.3.4. Analysis plan*

One member of the research team (PW) took contemporaneous notes during each workshop. Recordings were subsequently reviewed by a second researcher (ES) to clarify or augment these notes. Three members of the research team who attended both workshops (PW, RLM, ES) conducted thematic analysis through discussion and further annotation of the participant feedback.

# *2.3.5. Approval of guidance*

Throughout the development effort, interim results were shared with the GRADE Working Group and GRADE Environmental Health Project Group, including presentations in October 2021, July 2022, and November 2022. We presented a summary of the final results to the GRADE Environmental Health Project Group (approximately 30 attendees) and all attendees at a subsequent meeting of the GRADE Working Group (approximately 65 attendees) in May 2023. The GRADE EtD framework for environmental health was formally approved by the GRADE Guidance Group on June 8, 2023.

#### **3. Results**

The GRADE EtD framework for EOH follows the same structure as its foundational framework, the GRADE EtD framework for health system and public health decisions (Pega et al., [2022\)](#page-10-0). This includes a scoping and contextualization process, and twelve assessment criteria (priority of the problem, desirable effects, undesirable effects, values, balance of effects, certainty of evidence, resources required, certainty of resources required, cost effectiveness, equity, acceptability, and feasibility) (Table 1 and 2). The GRADE EtD framework for EOH differs from other EtD frameworks in the organization and wording of the scoping criteria, and the detailed judgments within each assessment criterion [\(Table](#page-6-0) 3). This tailoring is based on cumulative insights from all three phases of the project, reflecting the theoretical and practical considerations that are relevant to EOH decision-making described in detail below. The framework is also accompanied by a user guide intended to support consistent interpretation and application of concepts across different groups [\(Table](#page-7-0) 4). Thus, the framework and guidance presented here are grounded in both the original GRADE EtD framework, and existing decision-making approaches that have been applied in EOH.

#### *3.1. Scope & context*

There are 10 scoping criteria in the GRADE EtD framework for EOH:

purpose, perspective, target population, setting, key coexisting conditions, types of interventions, key stakeholders/users, key resources, key implementation issues, and existing documents (Table 1). The scoping process is intended to outline the parameters or conditions under which the decision will be made. It is also an opportunity to define the options under consideration. For decisions about exposures, the options may be complete discontinuation of an existing exposure vs. continuation at a specific threshold (e.g., banning the use of polychlorinated biphenyls in manufacturing vs. implementation of a permissible exposure limit), or selection of an alternative to a harmful exposure (e.g., synthetic esters vs. perfluorinated compounds as an alternative to polychlorinated biphenyls). For decisions about interventions, options may be different exposure thresholds (e.g., ≤8 h of exposure to 90 dB vs. ≤ 8 h of exposure to 85 dB), or selection of measures to mitigate the effects of exposures that may be harmful (e.g., physical sound barriers vs. lubrication of machinery to reduce decibel levels). Ultimately, the specific options under consideration should be defined by the relevant stakeholders and subject matter experts.

*Findings:* Results of our literature review and modified Delphi process did not suggest any changes to the existing EtD framework scoping criteria. However, stakeholder reactions to the assessment criteria underlined the importance of the scoping components of the EtD. Omitting the scoping process may result in confusion about the intent or target of the assessment criteria questions. Judgments about the acceptability of different alternatives, for example, are contingent on the key stakeholder groups identified during scoping.

*Implications:* As the scoping criteria are critical to answering subsequent assessment questions, the guidance for users emphasizes their importance and advises decision-makers to refer to their pre-specified parameters to answer related signaling questions [\(Table](#page-7-0) 4). This is evident in the following criteria: problem, desirable effects, undesirable effects, values, and acceptability.

We also revised existing guidance for the scoping process to change the terminology and examples from clinical decision types to environmental health (Table A). For example, guidance about selecting a

perspective was changed from "individual patients, their families, providers caring for those patients, public health, health system, payer, population (the society), etc." to "impact on a specific group (e.g., workers) vs. overall population/societal impact, human health vs. one health.".

# *3.2. Priority of the problem*

*Findings:* The problem, question, or issue that is the subject of discussion (e.g., should incineration vs. landfills be used for disposal of residual polychlorinated biphenyls) is largely assumed to be a priority by the time a decision-making process has begun. Topics may be prioritized through a separate process and EOH decision-makers do not typically reconsider importance or magnitude of the problem when assessing different solutions. Consequently, the purpose of this criterion may be unclear to target users.

*Implications:* The guidance clarifies that this criterion may be useful for decision-makers to disaggregate and document why some issues are more or less important, and to revisit the stakes of the final decision when assessing the options. This is reflected in the detailed judgments, which ask decision-makers to reflect on the consequences and urgency of the issue at hand, and whether the political system or local community has identified the problem as a priority. Priorities also may evolve from the time a topic is prioritized to when it is addressed; decisionmakers can note that here.

# *3.3. Magnitude of desirable and undesirable health effects*

*Findings:* The possible benefits and harms (desirable and undesirable health effects) of an exposure or intervention may include health outcomes such as lung disease, and indirect or surrogate effects, such as job loss leading to a loss of health care benefits. Health outcomes are partly a product of the social, economic, and geographic context. EOH interventions may impact health through changing this context, and these effects may be as important to stakeholders as direct outcomes on health. It is also common for EOH exposures to have no potential benefits (e.g., lead). On the other hand, interventions to mitigate harmful exposures (e.g., abatement or encapsulation of lead-based paint) may have benefits, such as reduction in the harmful health effects caused by the exposure. Both types of effects should be explicitly accounted for by the decision-making process. Finally, timing of the desirable and undesirable effects is an important consideration when balancing the benefits and harms of a potential exposure or intervention. Undesirable effects may be immediate (e.g., loss of employment, loss of access to certain chemicals with important uses), while desirable effects manifest over a longer period of time (e.g., reduction in new cases of health conditions).

*Implications:* The guidance clarifies that decision-makers should explicitly state when there are no known benefits, or that benefits were not considered and why not. The organized process of considering both desirable and undesirable effects is useful in any case because decisionmakers may not be able to predict which criteria will be relevant until they begin an assessment of the options, and because it facilitates documentation of factors that were judged to be irrelevant or unimportant. Otherwise, stakeholders may conclude that these factors were not considered at all. Additionally, detailed judgments about the timing of an exposure or intervention to reach full effect were added to the desirable and undesirable effects criteria. Decision-makers should note any relevant time points when documenting judgments about the balance of effects, giving particular attention to the time point that was given the most weight.

#### *3.4. Values*

*Findings:* EOH decision-makers frequently must account for differences in values, even when considering only the intended beneficiaries <span id="page-6-0"></span>Summary of research findings informing development of the GRADE EtD framework for environmental and occupational health.

of the recommendation (e.g., different values within a group of mine workers based on age). The scope of EOH exposures or interventions often includes opposing values both within and across target populations.

or intervention

*Implications:* Detailed judgments within the values criterion aim to identify uncertainty about and unexplained differences (inconsistency or variability) in values within the group or groups that are intended to benefit from the decision. Guidance refers decision-makers back to their scoping process to identify whose values should be considered and how to account for unexplained differences in the values of their target audience with their response to this criterion.

#### *3.5. Resources required*

*Findings:* Existing EOH decision frameworks have poor generalizability in part due to the specificity of their resource considerations. A framework developed to address decisions about water and sanitation projects, for example, lists specific resource types that may not apply outside of this scenario: non-renewable energy consumption, water consumption, raw material consumption, etc (Garfi and [Ferrer-Marti,](#page-10-0)

[2011\)](#page-10-0). EOH decision-makers also raised the issue of financial responsibility for implementation of an intervention or threshold, including reference to the "polluter pays" principle ([Senerth](#page-10-0) et al., [2025\)](#page-10-0).

*Implications:* The GRADE EtD framework aims to describe concepts that are generalizable to many EOH decision types. Detailed judgments about resources prompt decision-makers to identify the resource types that are relevant to their scenario rather than providing a checklist of possible resources to consider. Additionally, distribution of responsibility for providing the required resources may be a particularly salient implementation consideration in EOH decision-making.

# *3.6. Cost effectiveness*

*Findings:* Cost-effectiveness is a relevant consideration in EOH and may be used to inform a final decision. Users can consult EOH organizations or other offices to solicit information on cost effectiveness, if it exists. However, there may be situations in which the relative cost effectiveness of an exposure or intervention does not drive decisionmaking in EOH, and evidence on cost effectiveness is often unavailable. Due to the consideration of both short- and long-term benefits and harms discussed above, decision-makers may also intuitively consider downstream, hypothetical costs and benefits in addition to the direct costs and benefits of an exposure or intervention.

*Implications:* We simplified the detailed judgements for the cost effectiveness criterion to address certainty in the cost effectiveness analysis, if available. Guidance for users elaborates on the intended scope of this criterion, which is to assess direct costs and benefits.

### *3.7. Equity*

*Findings:* EOH decision-makers often must account for both intended and unintended impacts on a community or target population. Deliberate consideration of the socio-political and economic context is important to recognize when an intervention or option may perpetuate or increase inequity, as these conditions are instrumental in shaping patterns of exposure. Failure to consider context may result in "interventions [with targets] that are resistant to change for unrecognized reasons." (Link and [Phelan,](#page-10-0) 1995) Social context is partially accommodated in other EtD framework criteria, such as values, acceptability, feasibility, but also should be accommodated in equity. This will account for disparities that are immediately connected to health outcomes, as well as further upstream from these outcomes. Consideration of equity in EOH decision-making extends beyond immediate health equity considerations to include the broader socio-economic context in which exposures or interventions occur.

*Implications:* Other GRADE EtD frameworks explicitly limit the scope of the equity criterion to "health equity." To improve applicability of the framework for EOH, we removed the "health" qualifier to accommodate all of the relevant dimensions by which equity may be assessed, including environmental justice. The detailed judgments have also been revised accordingly to provide guidance for decision-makers to conduct a comprehensive assessment of equity.

#### *3.8. Acceptability*

*Findings:* EOH exposures or interventions may be involuntary (e.g., installation of a wind farm adjacent to a residential area) or compulsory (e.g., imposition of maximum allowable exposure threshold). Additionally, exposures may be situated within a specific time span and geographic space (e.g., seasonal use of pesticides containing glyphosate). These factors impact judgments about whether an exposure or intervention is acceptable. Additionally, the response to this criterion will differ based on which constituencies are considered. For example, owners of a coal mine would presumably view closure of the mine differently than members of the surrounding community.

*Implications:* Pre-specifying the stakeholders is essential to making transparent and explainable judgments about whether an option is acceptable. The detailed judgements and user guidance for this criterion also explain how to account for uncertainty about or variability in attitudes between disparate stakeholder groups.

#### *3.9. Feasibility*

*Findings:* When assessing feasibility, EOH decision-makers may consider whether the legal and regulatory context provides an enforcement mechanism for a recommendation or exposure threshold. They may also be interested in a specific duration of time through which the exposure or intervention must be maintained.

*Implications:* The detailed judgements and user guidance for this criterion have been augmented to include consideration of laws and regulations as potential barriers or facilitators to implementation, and to encourage specification of the relevant time period for sustainability.

#### **4. Discussion**

Through all phases of the development effort, we did not identify any concepts applied in EOH decision-making that are distinct from those described in the GRADE EtD framework. For example, criteria such as consideration of acceptability, feasibility, and resource use are commonly seen in EOH decision approaches and also represented in the EtD framework. Thus, incompatibility of the framework content with EOH contexts does not explain why the GRADE EtD framework is not currently being used in EOH decision-making. Other possible explanations plausibly include some combination of the following factors: lack of awareness about the EtD framework due to relatively recent adoption of the GRADE approach in EOH; rejection of the EtD framework because of an appearance of incompatibility with EOH decision scenarios, due to the clinical terminology and examples through which the framework is presented; hesitancy about the applicability and veracity of a framework that was not explicitly developed to address EOH decisions; and challenges for new users in interpreting and implementing the framework, especially in situations where evidence to inform judgments may be lacking. We have aimed to address these factors through development of a new GRADE EtD framework for EOH and accompanying guidance.

Decision-makers may find the structure of the GRADE EtD framework for EOH useful when evaluating complex tradeoffs between potential benefits and harms over time, assessing options with only adverse health outcomes (no potential benefits), accounting for both direct and indirect effects on equity, and balancing opposing stakeholder views. For example, in a recent regulatory impact analysis on emissions standards for ethylene oxide (EtO), the EPA weighed an estimated reduction in cancer risk to local populations (long-term benefit) alongside potential constraints to the medical device supply chain resulting in shortages (short-term harm), among many other considerations. In addition to the differing impacts over time, affected stakeholders (local residents, companies that use EtO for sterilization, patients of the health system, and others) may have very different values about the possible consequences of changing the emission standard. Further, the EPA conducted an environmental justice analysis to support this decision and found that African Americans and households with income below the poverty line are disproportionately represented in areas with higher risk sterilization facilities, representing variability in baseline conditions across the target population of local communities ([Health](#page-10-0) et al., 2024). The framework and guidance presented herein have been developed with the aim of accommodating many common EOH decision-making circumstances. The GRADE EtD framework for EOH reflects concepts that are evident in existing approaches to decision-making but may be applied inconsistently across different decisions and organizations. Given the unique challenges described above, using a standard framework to document and explain the judgments that inform a decision may be useful to establish the credibility of the process and, ultimately, foster understanding and acceptance of the decision by stakeholders.

Although we primarily aimed to address barriers to EtD framework implementation that were surfaced by EOH stakeholders, certain modifications to the GRADE EtD framework criteria and detailed judgments may also be applicable beyond the EOH context. These include the addition of timing as a consideration for the desirable effects, undesirable effects, balance of effects, and feasibility criteria, and the broadened scope of the equity criterion to include contextual factors in addition to direct effects on health.

The resulting guidance also contains information that may have cross-cutting relevance to all of the GRADE EtD frameworks. This includes clarification of common terms, introduction of new examples, and further elaboration on the intended application of various response options. One key message of the guidance is that decision-makers may have difficulty answering the assessment criteria questions if they have not addressed the preceding scope and context issues. The scoping component of the GRADE EtD framework for EOH establishes the parameters for decision-making that facilitate analysis of different options.

Another key message is that while decision-makers may judge any component of the EtD framework as inapplicable to their scenario, the function of the framework is to provide a standard list of prompts and document any judgments about their relevance for justification and explanation to stakeholders. Alternately, the evidence available to inform judgments about a relevant criterion (e.g., undesirable effects, cost-effectiveness, etc.) may be very low certainty or entirely unavailable. In this case, systematic consideration of all the relevant decision factors and identification of the evidence gaps is particularly important. Decision-makers may reasonably elect to make a judgment for any criterion based on indirect or modeled evidence, or cumulative experience with documentation of the process and uncertainty [\(Mustafa](#page-10-0) et al., [2021\)](#page-10-0). In the context of an emergency, urgent, or rapid response, decisions may be necessary regardless of whether high certainty evidence is available (Thayer and [Schünemann,](#page-10-0) 2016). In other words, the framework does not supplant judgment by EOH decision-makers, but rather provides a tool to make these judgments transparent and replicable.

The guidance also aims to address a common scenario in which there is more than one reasonable response to an assessment criterion. For example, decision-makers who are split between two neighboring options (e.g., "small" vs. "trivial" undesirable effects) should pick the best fit based on group consensus or majority vote. A split between options that are more than one degree apart (e.g., "moderate" vs. "trivial" undesirable effects) necessitates further discussion to elucidate and document the justification for each possible answer, followed by group consensus or majority vote. Decision-makers are encouraged to define thresholds for consensus and procedures for resolving disagreement before beginning the assessment process. Finally, decision-makers may also find it helpful to engage an external facilitator with experience applying the GRADE EtD framework, whether or not they are approaching the process from an EOH perspective.

# *4.1. Strengths and limitations*

We followed a robust process to adapt an existing GRADE EtD framework for a new context, including conducting a systematic review and narrative synthesis of environmental and occupational health decision frameworks, a modified Delphi study to collect and organize feedback from subject matter experts, and a series of workshops to test the framework assessment criteria.

However, this work has several important limitations. Engagement of target audiences was challenging due to logistical constraints that limited workshop participation. The perspectives represented by the Delphi panel and workshop participants are not comprehensive of all EOH decision-makers. Judgments by these investigators to interpret and operationalize information are inherently subjective and may not be replicable. Finally, we were unable to include the scoping component of the framework in the piloting exercise due to time constraints.

#### *4.2. Implications for practice, policy, and research*

Future research will involve additional testing and validation of the framework, specifically the scope and context criteria. This may include additional qualitative research into current practices and attitudes towards decision-making in environmental and occupational health, and user acceptance testing of the GRADE EtD for EOH in simulated or reallife decision scenarios. Feedback from and testing with users will inform modifications, if needed. Finally, it may be useful to explore the generalizability of findings from the development of the GRADE EtD for EOH and accompanying guidance to other EtD frameworks, such as an EtD framework that considers planetary health which GRADE is currently exploring.

#### **5. Conclusion**

This article describes the development, composition, and guidance for operationalization of a new GRADE EtD framework for EOH. This work was undertaken to provide a standardized and transparent method for integrating research evidence and other relevant factors when <span id="page-10-0"></span>formulating EOH decisions. Approaches to reduce barriers to GRADE EtD framework implementation in EOH may also be helpful in other contexts.
