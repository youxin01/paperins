*Keywords:* PPD antioxidant PPD-quinone Emerging contaminants Particle size effect Atmospheric transformation ABSTRACT

Transformed from *p*-phenylenediamines (PPDs) antioxidant, PPD-derived quinones (PPD-Qs) have recently been recognized as emerging contaminants due to their potential negative impacts on the environment and human health. While there have been measurements of airborne PPD-Qs, the size distribution of PPD-Qs and the impact of particle size on PPD transformation chemistry remain largely unknown. Here, through the measurements of atmospheric particles in three megacities in China (Beijing, Xi'an, and Hefei), we find that PPD-Qs are widely distributed in these cities. Further analysis of the size-fractioned particles in Hefei indicates that 48 % of PPD-Qs reside in coarse particles. Given that previous studies mainly focus on the measurement of PPD-Qs in fine particles, the previously reported PPD-Q concentrations and the corresponding human exposure dosages are likely to be significantly underestimated. Furthermore, the ratio of PPD-Q to PPD concentration (PPD-Q/PPD) for particles with size range of 0.056 − 0.1 μm is up to 3 times higher than that with size range of 10 − 18 μm, highlighting the key role of particle size in determining the atmospheric oxidation reactivity of PPDs. Model simulations reveal a size-dependent pattern for the estimated concentration of particulate PPD-Qs in human body. In addition, we also demonstrate that PPD-Qs can induce the formation of cellular reactive oxygen species, suggesting that they may pose risks to human health. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of considering the particle size effect when evaluating the reaction potential and exposure risk of airborne PPD-Qs.

# **1. Introduction**

*p*-Phenylenediamines (PPDs) are synthetic antioxidants widely used as additives in rubber products to resist the oxidative aging of rubber ([Huntink et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2023a\)](#page-7-0). The frequently used PPDs include *N*-1,3-dimethylbutyl-*N'*-phenyl-*p*-phenylenediamine (6PPD), *N*isopropyl-*N*'-phenyl-*p*-phenylenediamine (IPPD), *N*-phenyl-*N'*- cyclohexyl-*p*-phenylenediamine (CPPD), *N,N'*-diphenyl-*p*-phenylenediamine (DPPD), *N,N'*-bis(methylphenyl)-1,4-benzenediamine (DTPD), and *N,N'*-bis(1,4-dimethylpentyl)-*p*-phenylenediamine (77PD) [\(U.S.](#page-8-0)  [EPA, 2022](#page-8-0)). The annual production volume of PPDs vary from 100 to 200,000 tons in different countries, with 6PPD being the most dominant PPD antioxidant [\(Rossomme et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2023](#page-8-0)). The massive use of PPDs in rubber products, particularly in vehicle tires, can lead to

their emissions into the global environment [\(Cao et al., 2022a; Huang](#page-7-0)  [et al., 2021; Johannessen et al., 2022a; Johannessen et al., 2022b; Liu](#page-7-0)  [et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020\)](#page-7-0). Recent evidence indicates that a transformation product of 6PPD from atmospheric ozone reaction, i.e., 6PPDquinone (6PPD-Q), can cause acute mortality in Pacific Northwest coho salmon [\(Tian et al., 2021\)](#page-8-0). Subsequent toxicity measurements reveal that 6PPD-Q can also induce negative impacts on other animals such as brook trout, rainbow trout, and white-spotted char [\(Brinkmann et al.,](#page-7-0)  [2022; Hiki et al., 2021; Hua and Wang, 2023b; Zhao et al., 2023b\)](#page-7-0). As a result, 6PPD-Q is considered as an emerging contaminant, and has gained substantial international attention.

PPDs and 6PPD-Q have been frequently detected in various environmental matrices such as water, sediments, soil, dust, and atmospheric particles over the past three years [\(Cao et al., 2023; Du et al.,](#page-7-0)  [2022; Hiki and Yamamoto, 2022; Liang et al., 2022; Maurer et al., 2023;](#page-7-0)  [Seiwert et al., 2022; Song et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2022a; Wang et al.,](#page-7-0)  [2022b; Wang et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024; Zoroufchi](#page-7-0)  [Benis et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2024; Mao et al., 2024](#page-7-0)). In the atmosphere, particle-bound PPDs (e.g., 6PPD, IPPD, CPPD) and 6PPD-Q have been measured in cities across the globe, including London, New York, Buenos Aires, Leipzig, Dresden, Sydney, and Nanjing, with the sum of all measured PPDs and 6PPD-Q ranging from 1 to 14,200 pg m<sup>−</sup> 3 and 0.17 to 7,250 pg m<sup>−</sup> <sup>3</sup> , respectively ([Johannessen et al., 2022b; Wang et al.,](#page-7-0)  [2022b; Zhang et al., 2022b; Zoroufchi Benis et al., 2023; Kuntz et al.,](#page-7-0)  [2024\)](#page-7-0). In addition to the well-studied 6PPD-Q, few recent studies found other PPD-Qs such as IPPD-quinone (IPPD-Q), CPPD-quinone (CPPD-Q), DPPD-quinone (DPPD-Q), DTPD-quinone (DTPD-Q), and 77PD-quinone (77PD-Q; structures shown in Table S1) were also presented in the air of Guangzhou and Hong Kong, with concentrations of up to 12,400 pg m<sup>−</sup> <sup>3</sup> ([Cao et al., 2022a; Wang et al., 2022b\)](#page-7-0). The ubiquitous presence of PPD-Qs in the atmospheric environment has stimulated concerns over their exposure risk [\(Zhang et al., 2022b; Zoroufchi Benis et al., 2023\)](#page-8-0). For example, it was estimated that the annual exposure dosage of 6PPD-Q for adults through inhalation could be up to 0.4 μg in Nanjing, representing a non-negligible exposure pathway [\(Zhang et al., 2022b](#page-8-0)).

Despite these recent advances, the understanding of atmospheric PPD-Qs and their potential exposure risk is incomplete. Previous studies on atmospheric PPD-Qs mainly focus on their measurements in particulate matter with a given size (e.g., PM2.5) ([Wang et al., 2022b; Zhang](#page-8-0)  [et al., 2022b\)](#page-8-0), while limited consideration has been given to their particle size distribution. Note that particle size may play an important role in both PPDs transformation chemistry and PPD-Qs exposure assessment. First, in theory, the heterogeneous reactivity of organic particles toward atmospheric oxidants (e.g., ozone and OH radical) can be sizedependent, as the case of palmitic acid particle [\(McNeill et al., 2008](#page-8-0)). This suggests that the atmospheric transformation chemistry of particulate PPDs may also be impacted by their particle size. Second, given that the exposure level of certain particle-bound contaminants (e.g., polybrominated diphenyl ethers) is highly size-dependent [\(Cao et al.,](#page-7-0)  [2019b; Li et al., 2021\)](#page-7-0), a similar case may also exist for atmospheric PPD-Qs. Both factors are essential for assessing the inhalation risk of PPD-Qs. There is currently only one report of the particle size distribution of one indoor airborne PPD-Q (6PPD-Q) in waste recycling plants ([Zhang et al., 2022a\)](#page-8-0). However, the chemical characteristics of 6PPD-Q (i.e., a single PPD-Q contaminant) in waste recycling plants may not reflect the characteristics of other PPD-Qs in outdoor environments. Little information is available regarding the size distribution and exposure to different particle-bound PPD-Qs in outdoor environments. Also, the potential impact of particle size on PPD transformation chemistry remains unknown.

To address this knowledge gap, here, we analyzed six PPDs and the corresponding PPD-Qs in atmospheric particle samples collected in three megacities in China (Beijing, Xi'an, and Hefei). Further analysis of the composition profiles of PPDs and PPD-Qs in size-fractioned particles in Hefei reveals a clear size-dependent distribution pattern for these contaminants, and highlights the important role of particle size in

determining the transformation chemistry of atmospheric PPDs. We also evaluated the human exposure level of PPD-Qs, and measured the cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production potential for PPD-Qs. Together, these results can advance the understanding on the sizedependent transformation of PPDs to PPD-Qs in the atmosphere as well as their exposure risks, in support of the ongoing risk evaluation efforts for these emerging contaminants.

## **2. Materials and methods**

## *2.1. Materials*

The target chemicals analyzed in this study include six PPDs (6PPD, IPPD, CPPD, DPPD, DTPD, and 77PD) and their transformation products (6PPD-Q, IPPD-Q, CPPD-Q, DPPD-Q, DTPD-Q, and 77PD-Q; Table S1). Details of the reagents (solvents, surrogate standards, and internal standards) used in this study can be found in the Supporting Information (SI) Text S1.

## *2.2. Atmospheric particle sampling*

Beijing, Xi'an and Hefei are three megacities which locate in Northern China, Western China, and Eastern China, respectively. To gain a full picture of the occurrence of atmospheric PPD-Qs in different regions in China, particle samples were collected from these cities. A total of 20 atmospheric particle samples were collected on glass fiber filters using a PM2.5 sampler (Dandong Ruite Technology, model RT-AP4; flow rate 16.7 L min<sup>−</sup> <sup>1</sup> ; sampling time 24 h) from June to August 2019, in China National Environmental Monitoring Centre at Beijing (40.04◦N, 116.42◦E) and in Urban Sports Park at Xi'an (34.35◦N, 108.94◦E). To investigate the particle size distribution of atmospheric PPD-Qs, 170 size-segregated particle samples were collected using a micro-orifice uniform deposit impactor (MOUDI; MSP Corporation, model 110; flow rate 30 L min<sup>−</sup> <sup>1</sup> ; sampling time 24 h) from June to December 2019, in the campus of University of Science and Technology of China at Hefei (117.27◦E, 31.84◦N). Size ranges of the captured particles include 0.056 − 0.1, 0.1 − 0.18, 0.18 − 0.32, 0.32 − 0.56, 0.56 − 1.0, 1.0 − 1.8, 1.8 − 3.2, 3.2 − 5.6, 5.6 − 10.0, and 10.0 − 18.0 μm, covering both coarse particles (*>* 1.8 μm) and fine particles (≤ 1.8 μm). The meteorological conditions and ozone concentrations were recorded simultaneously. All particle samples were wrapped in aluminum foil and stored at − 20 ℃ until analyzed.

## *2.3. Sample pretreatment and instrumental analysis*

Scraps of 1/2 particle filters were shredded and spiked with surrogate standards of 2 ng. The samples were ultrasonically extracted for 15 min with 6 mL of dichloromethane, and then the extraction procedure was repeated with 6 mL of acetonitrile. After centrifugation, the combined extracts were evaporated under nitrogen to near dryness and dissolved in 0.2 mL of methanol. The samples were filtered through a 0.22 μm PTFE filter membrane and then spiked with 2 ng of internal standard before instrumental analysis.

The analytes were analyzed using an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatograph coupled with a triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (AB Sciex 4000, MA, USA). Chromatographic separation was conducted using a C18 column (Waters XBridge BEH, 2.5 μm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm), with operation details given in the SI Text S1. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was used for quantitative analysis, with instrumental parameters shown in Table S2.

## *2.4. Quality assurance/Quality control*

No rubber-related products were used during sample pretreatment. Glass fiber filters were baked at 550 ℃ for 4 h before sampling to avoid potential contamination. One procedural blank sample was included in

every batch of 10 samples to monitor laboratory background contamination. The target compounds were not detected in procedural blank samples. Also, no contamination was found in the field blank samples, validating the feasibility of the sample collection method. The recoveries of the target compounds in particulate matter spiked samples were in the range of 77.1 − 90.5 % (Table S2). Matrix effects for these compounds were calculated by comparing the response from spiked sample extracts with that of their respective standards in pure solvents. The matrix effects were determined to be 70.5 − 91.3 %, suggesting no significant ionization suppression or enhancement. The method quantification limits (MQLs) were set to the concentration in the particle matrix that generated a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 (Table S2).

## *2.5. Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement*

ROS are oxygen-containing molecules that have one or more unpaired electrons, which include free radicals such as hydroxyl radical, superoxide radical, and peroxyl radicals ([Bates et al., 2019](#page-7-0)). ROS assay has been widely used in investigating of the oxidative potential of atmospheric particles [\(Bates et al., 2019; Chowdhury et al., 2019; Grange](#page-7-0)  [et al., 2022\)](#page-7-0). Human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC-D3; Shanghai Anwei Biotechnology) were exposed to four PPD-Qs (6PPD-Q, IPPD-Q, CPPD-Q, and 77PPD-Q dissolved in DMSO) at three different concentrations (0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 μM; see details for the selection of these concentrations in SI Text S2). DPPD-Q and DTPD-Q experiments were not conducted due to their limited solubility in DMSO. The cellular ROS production was determined using a ROS assay kit (Beyotime Biotech Inc.). The cells (2 × 107 cells mL<sup>−</sup> <sup>1</sup> ) were stained with 5 μM DCFH-DA at 37 ℃ for 20 min, and then the fluorescence intensity of DCF were quantified using a flow cytometry (BD FACS-Canto). The concentration of DMSO in all exposure experiments was maintained at 0.1 % (v:v). Further details regarding the cell culture can be found in the SI.

## *2.6. Human exposure assessment*

The estimated daily intake (EDI; pg kgbw <sup>−</sup> 1 day<sup>−</sup> <sup>1</sup> ) of humans to PPDs and PPD-Qs through inhalation of atmospheric particles was calculated using the following equation:

$$\text{EDI} = \frac{\text{C} \times \text{IR} \times \text{ET} \times \text{EF} \times \text{ED}}{\text{BW} \times \text{AT}} \tag{1}$$

where C is the concentration of atmospheric PPDs or PPD-Qs (pg m<sup>−</sup> <sup>3</sup> ). IR, ET, EF, and ED represent the inhalation rates of air (m3 h<sup>−</sup> <sup>1</sup> ), exposure time (h day<sup>−</sup> <sup>1</sup> ), exposure frequency (days year<sup>−</sup> <sup>1</sup> ), and exposure duration (years), respectively. BW and AT are human body weight (kg) and average time during exposure (days), respectively. The parameters used for EDI calculation were selected based on the recommendations of previous studies (Table S3) [\(Maceira et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2023;](#page-7-0)  [Zhang et al., 2018](#page-7-0)).

The above EDI calculation reflects the rate for chemicals to get through the external boundary of human body, often referred to as external exposure. Exposure assessment also needs to consider internal exposures using the estimated body (blood) concentration (EBC) as an endpoint. For chemicals entering the body via inhalation of atmospheric particles, EBC is influenced by the size dependent efficiency of particles trapped in respiratory system (deposition efficiency), and the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion processes within the body (Fig. S1). While the processes and factors affecting chemicals' concentrations are complicated, here we use a previously developed screeninglevel human model to link external exposure and internal exposure (see SI Text S3) ([Bennett et al., 2002](#page-7-0); [U.S. EPA, 2011;](#page-8-0) [Zhang et al., 2014](#page-8-0)). The model considers the efficiency of inhaled particles loaded into lungs as well as the removal of chemicals from human body due to metabolism and urination [\(Arnot et al., 2014; Brown, 2014; Brown et al., 2012](#page-7-0)).

## *2.7. Statistical analysis*

Statistical analyses of targeted chemicals were performed using SPSS 25. As determined by the Shapiro − Wilk test, due to non-normality in the distribution of the concentration data, the concentration relationship between individual analytes was assessed by Spearman's correlation analysis. The difference in fluorescence intensity between different groups was checked by the Mann − Whitney *U* test, with statistical significance set at *p <* 0.05 and *p <* 0.01.

## **3. Results and discussion**

## *3.1. PPDs and PPD-Qs in fine particles*

The occurrence of atmospheric PPDs and PPD-Qs in Beijing, Xi'an, and Hefei was reported for the first time. Among the target analytes, 4 PPDs (6PPD, IPPD, CPPD, and DPPD) and 6 PPD-Qs (6PPD-Q, IPPD-Q, CPPD-Q, DPPD-Q, DTPD-Q, and 77PD-Q) were detected in all particle samples. To compare the levels of PPDs and PPD-Qs in fine particles among different cities, the PM2.5 data from Beijing, Xi'an, and Hefei were analyzed, as summarized in [Table 1.](#page-3-0) As shown in [Fig. 1](#page-3-0)A, the median concentrations of total PPDs and PPD-Qs in fine particles in Beijing (44.6 and 109 pg m<sup>−</sup> <sup>3</sup> , respectively) are similar to those in Xi'an (34.6 and 98.1 pg m<sup>−</sup> <sup>3</sup> , respectively; Mann − Whitney *U* test; *p >* 0.05), but are 2.5 − 4.9 times higher than those in Hefei (9.1 and 38.7 pg m<sup>−</sup> <sup>3</sup> , respectively; *p <* 0.01). The median concentrations of total PPDs and PPD-Qs in these three cities were higher than those in Leipzig, Dresden, London, and New York (total PPDs: 1.31 − 3.89 pg m<sup>−</sup> <sup>3</sup> ; total PPD-Qs: 0.37 − 9.51 pg m<sup>−</sup> <sup>3</sup> ) ([Kuntz et al., 2024; Johannessen et al., 2022b](#page-7-0)). The difference in the atmospheric abundance of PPDs and PPD-Qs in these cities can be attributed to their emission sources. Abrasion of vehicle tires has been suggested as the primary pathway for PPDs to be released into the environment [\(Johannessen et al., 2022a; Tian et al.,](#page-7-0)  [2021\)](#page-7-0). Indeed, high concentration of 6PPD (2.3 mg g<sup>−</sup> <sup>1</sup> ) was detected in tire wear particles [\(Zhao et al., 2023a](#page-8-0)). The higher vehicle population in Beijing and Xi'an (relative to Hefei; 3.4 − 5.9 million in Beijing and Xi'an vs. 2.2 million in Hefei) will likely lead to higher emissions of PPDs in these two cities, resulting in higher concentrations of atmospheric PPDs and the corresponding PPD-Q transformation products.

A closer inspection of the composition profile of PPDs reveal that 6PPD is the major component, which accounts for 33.8 − 53.1 % of the total PPDs in three cities [\(Fig. 1](#page-3-0)B). A similar trend was observed for its transformation product 6PPD-Q, which possessed the highest proportion (33.7 − 56.0 %) among the detected PPD-Qs, and had a median concentration of up to 52.1 pg m<sup>−</sup> <sup>3</sup> . This is consistent with the PM2.5 measurement results in Guangzhou, which showed that 6PPD and 6PPD-Q comprised 57 % and *>* 50 % of the total PPDs and PPD-Qs, respectively [\(Wang et al., 2022b](#page-8-0)). This is also consistent with the measurement results in other environmental media such as roadside soil in Hong Kong and sediments in South China Sea, which indicated that 6PPD and 6PPD-Q were the dominant components among the detected PPDs and PPD-Qs ([Cao et al., 2022a; Zeng et al., 2023](#page-7-0)). Regardless, the higher proportion of 6PPD and 6PPD-Q in atmospheric particles is likely related to the widespread use of 6PPD in rubber products; the production volume of 6PPD is reported to be 200,000 tons in China in 2020 ([Zeng et al., 2023](#page-8-0)). In addition to 6PPD-Q, IPPD-Q and DPPD-Q were also detected in the fine particles collected from three cities, with median concentrations of up to 27.9 and 28.2 pg m<sup>−</sup> <sup>3</sup> , respectively. Combined with 6PPD-Q, these PPD-Qs accounted for up to 92.2 % of the total PPD-Qs, while other PPD-Qs (CPPD-Q, DTPD-Q, and 77PD-Q) had a relative lower proportion (7.8 − 15.6 %).

Further analysis of fine particle-bound PPDs and PPD-Qs in three cities indicates that individual PPDs have positive Spearman correlations with their corresponding PPD-Qs (Fig. S2). Similar atmospheric PPDs − PPD-Qs correlations were also observed in cities such as Nanjing and Shanghai ([Zhang et al., 2022b](#page-8-0)). Together, the results demonstrate

# *3.2. Size dependence of atmospheric PPDs and PPD-Qs*

To provide insights into the particle size distribution of PPDs and PPD-Qs, the size-fractioned particle samples collected in Hefei (size range 0.056 − 18 μm) were analyzed. As shown in [Fig. 2A](#page-3-0) and B, both PPDs and PPD-Qs exhibited clear size-dependent trends: their concentrations increased with increasing particle size. For example, the median concentrations of 6PPD-Q and IPPD-Q in the particles with size range of 10 − 18 μm (4.2 and 1.5 pg m<sup>−</sup> <sup>3</sup> , respectively) were 31 % and 88 % higher than those in smaller particles with size range of 0.056 − 0.1 μm (3.2 and 0.8 pg m<sup>−</sup> <sup>3</sup> , respectively), respectively. The observed sizedependent trend of PPD-Qs is in agreement with a previous measurement report of indoor airborne 6PPD-Q in waste recycling plants ([Zhang](#page-8-0)  [et al., 2022a](#page-8-0)). The size distribution of PPDs and PPD-Qs may be rationalized through the analysis of the physicochemical properties of tire wear particles (TWPs). Previous laboratory measurements of airborne TWPs formed during driving demonstrated that coarse particles accounted for up to 70 % of the mass of TWPs ([Kim and Lee, 2018;](#page-7-0)  [Kupiainen et al., 2005](#page-7-0)). Under such a scenario, the TWP-containing PPDs and their transformation products PPD-Qs will mainly reside in coarse particles, consistent with the measurement results in [Fig. 2](#page-3-0)A and B.

For particles with a given size, the measured mean concentration of 6PPD-Q in Hefei air (e.g., 2.8 pg m<sup>−</sup> 3 for particles with size range of 5.6 − 10 μm) was much lower than the previously reported concentration in waste recycling plants (e.g., 20.5 pg m<sup>−</sup> 3 for particles with size range of 5.8 − 9 μm) [\(Zhang et al., 2022a\)](#page-8-0). The lower 6PPD-Q concentration in Hefei air can be expected given that the emission intensity of airborne organic contaminants are generally higher in waste recycling plants than in outdoor environments ([Hu et al., 2019; Yue et al., 2022; Zhang et al.,](#page-7-0)  [2019\)](#page-7-0).

In addition, the size distribution of PPD-Qs is distinct from other emerging contaminants such as organophosphate esters (OPEs) [\(Li et al.,](#page-7-0)  [2021\)](#page-7-0). It was found that atmospheric OPEs [e.g., tricresyl phosphate, and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate] were mainly distributed in particles with aerodynamic diameter below 1.8 μm (i.e., in fine particles) [\(Li](#page-7-0)  [et al., 2021](#page-7-0)). The size distribution difference between PPD-Qs and OPEs can be attributed to their different emission sources (see further discussion in SI Text S4). As noted above, tire abrasion has been suggested as a major contributor to atmospheric PPDs and PPD-Qs [\(Johannessen](#page-7-0)  [et al., 2022a; Tian et al., 2021](#page-7-0)). In the case of OPEs, their sources are more complex, which include vaporization and mechanical abrasion of OPE-containing commercial products (e.g., building materials, furniture, and electronic devices) used in both indoor and outdoor

environments [\(Cao et al., 2019a; Cao et al., 2022b](#page-7-0)). Given this, atmospheric PPD-Qs can be potentially used as marker compounds to evaluate the air pollution exposure related to vehicle tires in future studies.

# *3.3. Impact of seasonal variation and particle size on the formation of PPD-Qs*

To elucidate the atmospheric behaviors of PPD-Qs, below we analysis the impact of seasonal variation and particle size on PPDs-to-PPD-Qs transformation chemistry.

## *3.3.1. Seasonal variation*

The ratio of product PPD-Q to parent PPD concentration (RPPD-Q/PPD) in atmospheric particles represents the extent of atmospheric oxidation. As shown in Fig. 3A, for the investigated four PPD-Q − PPD pairs (6PPD-Q − 6PPD, IPPD-Q − IPPD, CPPD-Q − CPPD, and DPPD-Q − DPPD), their RPPD-Q/PPD for PM18 in Hefei air are up to 54.3 % higher in summer than in winter. The seasonality for RPPD-Q/PPD may be caused by two reasons. First, the atmospheric oxidation reaction rate of PPDs can be enhanced with increasing temperature (the mean temperature in Hefei during summer and winter is 27.1 and 11.3 ℃, respectively) [\(Weyrauch](#page-8-0)  [et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024\)](#page-8-0). Second, the measured mean ozone mixing ratio and mean solar radiation intensity in summer (45.2 ppb and 242 W m<sup>−</sup> <sup>2</sup> , respectively) are significantly higher than in winter (mean ozone mixing ratio 28.4 ppb; mean solar radiation intensity 109 W m<sup>−</sup> <sup>2</sup> ). The higher levels of atmospheric ozone as well as strong light intensity in summer (relative to winter) will also facilitate the transformation reactions of PPDs, as demonstrated by previous experimental studies on 6PPD reactions with ozone and with sunlight ([Fohet et al., 2023;](#page-7-0)  [Weyrauch et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024\)](#page-7-0). These factors (temperature, ozone level, and light intensity) can enhance the formation of PPD-Qs during summer.

# *3.3.2. Impact of particle size*

It is interesting to note that fine particles possess higher RPPD-Q/PPD compared to coarse particles. For example, the mean value of R6PPD-Q/ 6PPD for particles with size range of 0.056 − 0.1 μm is 3 times higher than that with size range of 10 − 18 μm (Fig. 3B). Similar RPPD-Q/PPD trends have also been observed for other PPD-Q − PPD pairs (IPPD-Q − IPPD, CPPD-Q − CPPD, and DPPD-Q − DPPD), as shown in Fig. 3B. One potential mechanism explaining such a difference in the oxidation levels of PPDs between different sized particles is that their heterogeneous reactivity is strongly dependent on the surface area-to-volume ratio (SA/ V) of particles. A previous experimental study on heterogeneous OH oxidation kinetics of particle-bound squalane showed that the squalane reactivity in small particles (SA/V 0.42 nm<sup>−</sup> <sup>1</sup> ) was 37 % higher than that in large particles (SA/V 0.26 nm<sup>−</sup> <sup>1</sup> ) ([Lim et al., 2017\)](#page-7-0). This suggests that



**Fig. 3.** (**A**) Comparison of the ratio of PM18 -bound PPD-Q to PPD concentrations (RPPD-Q/PPD) during different seasons (summer and winter) in Hefei. (**B**) Comparison of RPPD-Q/PPD (mean value) between different sized particles (0.056 − 18 μm) in Hefei. The measurement results in B are based on summer data, while the measurement results in winter are shown in Fig. S8. The dashed lines are guides for the eye only.

<span id="page-5-0"></span>organic particles with a higher SA/V will have a higher heterogeneous reaction rate. Following this logic, the transformation rate of particlebound PPDs will likely increase with decreasing particle size (i.e., increasing SA/V; see Fig. S3), leading to a higher RPPD-Q/PPD for smallsized particles.

In addition, another possible reason explaining the observed RPPD-Q/ PPD difference in [Fig. 3B](#page-4-0) is that ozone is constrained within a reactodiffusive depth (d) in atmospheric particles during gas-particle reactions. The reacto-diffusive depth represents the depth to which gaseous ozone diffuses in particles while reacting with particle-bound organics [\(Alpert et al., 2019; Berkemeier et al., 2016\)](#page-7-0). That means below this depth in particles, ozone is unable to penetrate. At the present time, the dozone in atmospheric particles is unavailable. However, previous studies demonstrated that dozone in several organics with diverse structure were in the range of 0.9 − 70 nm (see Table S4) [\(Katrib et al.,](#page-7-0)  [2004; Lee and Wilson, 2016; Steimer et al., 2014; Wylie and Abbatt,](#page-7-0)  [2020; Zhou et al., 2019](#page-7-0)). Here, by assuming that the dozone in atmospheric particles is 30 nm (i.e., within the previously reported range), we estimate the ratio of ozone-reacting volume to the total particle volume (Rreact) for different sized-particles. Taking spherical particles with radius of 100 and 1,000 nm for example, the Rreact of 100 nm particles (Rreact = 0.66) is 7.3 times higher than that of 1,000 nm particles (Rreact = 0.09; see Fig. S3). Note that a higher Rreact reflects a higher possibility for particle-bound PPDs to interact with ozone to form PPD-Qs. Consequently, small-sized particles (i.e., having a higher Rreact) will likely possess a higher RPPD-Q/PPD, consistent with the results in [Fig. 3](#page-4-0)B.

## *3.4. Human exposure assessment*

Based on the median concentrations of PM18-bound PPDs and PPD-Qs in Hefei air, the EDI of these emerging contaminants through ambient air inhalation for different subpopulation groups (children and adults) were assessed. The EDI of total PPDs and PPD-Qs for children were calculated to be 5.4 and 17.1 pg kg bw<sup>−</sup> 1 d<sup>−</sup> <sup>1</sup> , respectively (for adults: 3.1 and 9.5 pg kg bw<sup>−</sup> 1 d<sup>−</sup> <sup>1</sup> , respectively). These calculated EDI levels for atmospheric PPD-Qs are significantly higher than those in Hong Kong (0.18 − 0.27 pg kg bw<sup>−</sup> 1 d<sup>−</sup> <sup>1</sup> ) [\(Cao et al., 2022a](#page-7-0)), but are lower than those in Guangzhou and Taiyuan (161 − 734 pg kg bw<sup>−</sup> 1 d<sup>−</sup> <sup>1</sup> ) ([Wang et al., 2022b\)](#page-8-0). In comparison to the EDIs through inhalation of other emerging contaminants such as OPEs, liquid crystal monomers (LCMs), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), the reported EDIs here are much lower than those of OPEs assessed in Guangzhou (48,000 − 135,000 pg kg bw<sup>−</sup> 1 d<sup>−</sup> <sup>1</sup> ) [\(Hu et al., 2019\)](#page-7-0), and are comparable to those of LCMs (11.8 − 26 pg kg bw<sup>−</sup> 1 d<sup>−</sup> <sup>1</sup> ) and PFAS (9 − 17.3 pg kg bw<sup>−</sup> 1 d<sup>−</sup> <sup>1</sup> ) assessed in Guangdong province, China [\(Liu et al.,](#page-7-0)  [2023; Yao et al., 2023\)](#page-7-0). In addition, these EDI levels are higher than the reported values for atmospheric benzothiazole and its derivatives (BTHs, another group of rubber-related contaminants) in Tianjing (2.3 − 4.1 pg kg bw<sup>−</sup> 1 d<sup>−</sup> <sup>1</sup> ) [\(Zhang et al., 2018](#page-8-0)). The potential health risk induced by long-term human exposure to airborne PPD-Qs need to be considered.

The contribution of particles with different sizes to the internal exposure of PPD-Qs (represented by EBCs) was analyzed using the screening-level human exposure model, with results shown in Fig. 4. The particle size attribution of EBCs of PPD-Qs exhibits a bimodal distribution pattern (with peaked contributions at particle size of 0.056 − 0.1 μm and 1.0 − 1.8 μm), which is distinct from the size distribution of atmospheric PPD-Qs (PPD-Q concentration increases with increasing particle size; see Fig. S4). As shown in Fig. S5, assuming that the particlebound PPD-Qs deposited onto the lung possess the same bioavailability, the particle deposition efficiency and the size distribution of PPD-Qs are the two major factors that influence the internal exposure result. Thus, the EBC data in Fig. 4 reflects the result of a combination of these factors. For example, particles with size range of 0.056 − 0.1 μm have lower PPD-Q concentrations but higher deposition efficiency in the pulmonary alveoli region (compared to particles with size range of 10 − 18 μm),



**Fig. 4.** The estimated body concentration for PPD-Qs bonded to different sized particles. The concentrations are estimated using a screening-level human model with the consideration of atmospheric PPD-Q levels in Hefei (see SI Text S3).

leading to a higher EBC for small-sized particles.

While the EBCs can be used for ranking chemicals of interest as an indicator of their internal exposure potential, it is noteworthy that the human model used in this study is a screening level generic exposure model with a number of assumptions/simplifications. With a one-box model, the EBCs represent concentrations in blood stream of the body as a whole, but in reality the concentrations of chemicals in blood streams at different location of the body vary significantly because different organs contribute differently on accumulating, metabolizing, and eliminating the chemicals [\(Peyret and Krishnan, 2011\)](#page-8-0). The model uncertainty not only comes from the model structure and assumptions, but also from the model input values which are mostly QSAR estimated (e.g., partition coefficient) due to the lack of experimental values. The uncertainty can be further evaluated once the measured body concentrations of a population become available, which also allow the human model to be refined and evaluated to further reduce the uncertainty of EBCs. Regardless, the modelling results indicate that the internal exposure of particle-bound PPD-Qs can be different from their external exposure and is particle size dependent. As such, the particle size effect should be considered critical when assessing the exposure risk of atmospheric PPD-Qs.

## *3.5. Cellular ROS formation*

As a recently discovered emerging contaminant, in addition to the atmospheric behaviors of PPD-Qs, we also need to consider their potential health impacts. ROS play an essential role in the health effects of particle-bound contaminants [\(Bates et al., 2019](#page-7-0)). Oxidative stress occurs when ROS level is in excess of the cellular antioxidant capacity, leading to a redox state change in cells that, in turn, can induce inflammation in the respiratory tract and cardiovascular systems [\(Sies et al., 2017](#page-8-0)). Thus, the capacity of contaminants to generate ROS (i.e., oxidative potential) has been suggested as a promising metric to evaluate their health effects ([Bates et al., 2019; Daellenbach et al., 2020\)](#page-7-0).

As shown in [Fig. 5](#page-6-0), exposure to PPD-Qs (6PPD-Q, IPPD-Q, CPPD-Q, and 77PPD-Q; 1 μM dosage) resulted in a significant increase in ROS levels in hCMEC-D3 cells. Specifically, the fluorescence intensity of DCF (an indicator for ROS level) in PPD-Q experiments was up to 69 % higher

<span id="page-6-0"></span>

**Fig. 5.** Cellular ROS measurement results from the exposure of hCMEC-D3 cells to PPD-Qs (at 1 μM dosage; n = 5). The fluorescence intensity of DCF is an indicator for ROS level. The experimental results for PPD-Qs at different dosage (0.01 − 1 μM; n = 5) are shown in Fig. S6. The signal in control group is likely caused by the impurities in solution [\(Mohamud Yusuf et al., 2024\)](#page-8-0). Mann − Whitney *U* test: \* p *<* 0.05, \*\* p *<* 0.01.

than that in control experiments. A positive relationship between the PPD-Q dosage and cellular ROS levels was also observed in the dosedependent experiments (0.1 − 1 μM PPD-Q; see Fig. S6). The underlying mechanism for PPD-Qs to produce ROS is likely related to their quinone structure. It is known that quinones possess redox-cycling capability and can catalyze electron transfer from cellular antioxidants (e.g., glutathione) to molecular oxygen, which will result in the formation of ROS such as hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide [\(Charrier](#page-7-0)  [and Anastasio, 2012; Sies et al., 2017\)](#page-7-0). The ROS measurement results in Fig. 5 are consistent with a previous acellular experiment on PPD-Qs which found that PPD-Qs had strong capacity to consume dithiothreitol (DTT; i.e., having high DTT activity) ([Wang et al., 2022a](#page-8-0)). Together, both the results from cellular and acellular experiments indicate that PPD-Qs have the potential to induce oxidative stress in cells and may cause negative health impact.

In addition, a recent study found that the oxidative potential of PPD-Qs contributed to up to 5.2 % of the oxidative potential of atmospheric particles in megacities in China [\(Wang et al., 2022a\)](#page-8-0). The results confirm that the health risk induced by atmospheric PPD-Qs is non-negligible. Recent animal studies also demonstrate that 6PPD-Q can induce a wide range of negative effects, including neurotoxicity, developmental toxicity, intestinal toxicity, reproductive toxicity, and lipid accumulation ([Brinkmann et al., 2022; Fang et al., 2023; He et al., 2024; Hua and](#page-7-0)  [Wang, 2023a, b\)](#page-7-0). The toxicity studies of other PPD-Qs (e.g., IPPD-Q and CPPD-Q) are relatively less compared to those of 6PPD-Q [\(Yang et al.,](#page-8-0)  [2024; Zhang et al., 2024](#page-8-0)). This calls for more research on the toxicity of IPPD-Q and CPPD-Q, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the health effect of these emerging contaminants.

## **4. Conclusions**

The present work provides new insights into the size dependence and human exposure of atmospheric PPD-Qs, which have important implications for future studies of these emerging contaminants, as discussed below.

First, it is essential to obtain accurate concentrations of PPD-Qs in air. Only by doing so can we accurately evaluate the exposure risk of airborne PPD-Qs. As mentioned above, previous studies on airborne PPD-Q mainly focused on the measurements in fine particles ([Tian et al.,](#page-8-0)  [2024; Wang et al., 2022b; Zhang et al., 2022b](#page-8-0)). Our results demonstrate that a considerable portion of atmospheric PPD-Qs (48 % in mass) reside in coarse particles (see Fig. S7). This indicates that the previously reported atmospheric PPD-Q concentrations as well as the corresponding human exposure dosages are likely to be significantly underestimated. The present work underscores the need to analyze coarse particle-bound PPD-Qs in future field measurements. Otherwise an accurate monitoring and exposure risk assessment for these contaminants cannot be achieved.

Second, in recent years, substantial attention has been paid to the chemical transformation of airborne emerging contaminants such as PPDs and OPEs ([Liu et al., 2021; Tian et al., 2021\)](#page-7-0). One of the key issues regarding atmospheric transformation chemistry of emerging contaminants is their reactivity. Emerging contaminants (including PPDs) can be distributed in different sized particles, however, fundamental knowledge of their reactivity is still lacking. Here, through the analysis of the concentrations of PPD-Q − PPD pairs in different sized particles, we confirm for the first time that particle size can significantly impact the atmospheric reactivity of PPDs, i.e., PPDs in small particles tend to have a higher reactivity compared to those in large particles. Given this, the likelihood is high that other emerging contaminants (e.g., OPEs) will have similar particle size effect during atmospheric transformation. Therefore, this size effect needs to be considered when assessing the atmospheric persistence of emerging contaminants.

Third, from a health perspective, our results highlight the key role of particle size in evaluating the human exposure of PPD-Qs. The exposure assessment of PPD-Qs indicates that the internal exposures to PPD-Qs are strongly related to the size of atmospheric particles [\(Fig. 4](#page-5-0)). Therefore, when evaluating the health effect of airborne emerging contaminants (including PPD-Qs), the impact of particle size on human exposure should be taken into account (which has rarely been considered in previous studies) ([Liu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022b;](#page-7-0)  [Zhang et al., 2022b\)](#page-7-0). This will contribute to a more complete understanding of the health risks associated with atmospheric PPD-Qs.
