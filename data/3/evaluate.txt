- Answer Error Analysis: Step 1 correctly extracts HOGP and CSI data but omits specific CSI values for exceptions (e.g., Morocco, Kenya, Cambodia) and does not quantify the lack of HOGP-CSI linkage for low-income countries. Step 2 inaccurately states Indonesia and Thailand received Asian Development Bank funding (context only confirms Indonesia and China). Step 3 lacks depth in discussing policy gaps, missing details on specific climate finance mechanisms (e.g., multilateral development banks) and their impact on lower-income countries.

- Answer Error Analysis: Step 1 accurately identifies the lack of standalone subsurface CDR but does not quantify the 47% of CGS countries mentioning CDR to emphasize the scale of interdependence. Step 2 correctly notes infrastructure repurposing but omits the higher cost and lower technological maturity of subsurface CDR as key drivers of interdependence. Step 3 assumes a "funding bias" toward fossil CCS without citing evidence of actual funding allocation, and the justice concerns are not fully linked to specific funding or policy mechanisms.

- Answer Error Analysis: Step 1 accurately summarizes advantages but does not quantify the extent of lower-income countriesâ€™ reliance on external funding (e.g., only Mozambique, Algeria, Morocco, Vietnam mentioned). Step 2 correctly identifies justice dimensions but omits intergenerational justice, which is explicitly mentioned in the context. Step 3 assumes CGS credits will crowd out nature-based removals without direct evidence, and the proposed solution (mandatory capacity-building) lacks specificity from the context.
