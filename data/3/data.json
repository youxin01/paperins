        "question": "How do the existing inequalities in CO2 geological storage (CGS) development, particularly between high-income and lower-income countries, influence the design of international climate finance mechanisms to ensure equitable access and benefit-sharing in carbon markets?",
        "answer": "The existing inequalities in CO2 geological storage (CGS) development between high-income and lower-income countries significantly influence the design of international climate finance mechanisms. High-income countries, particularly those with historic oil and gas production (HOGP), have multiple advantages, including technical data, experience, skills, supply chains, legislative frameworks, and economic wealth, which lower-income countries lack. These disparities raise moral and ethical justice concerns, necessitating carefully designed carbon market and climate finance policies to ensure equitable access and benefit-sharing. \n\n   Step 1: The context highlights that lower-income countries often rely on multilateral development banks and climate change funds for CGS development, as seen with Mozambique, Algeria, Morocco, and Vietnam receiving World Bank funding. This underscores the need for targeted financial support to bridge the gap.\n\n   Step 2: Climate finance mechanisms must prioritize capacity building and project funding in lower-income countries to address their lower readiness levels. For example, the Asian Development Bank's Carbon Capture and Storage Fund supported projects in Indonesia and China, demonstrating the effectiveness of such interventions.\n\n   Step 3: Carbon markets should be designed to avoid exacerbating inequalities. High-income countries dominating CGS infrastructure could monopolize financial benefits, so mechanisms like cross-border offtake arrangements or revenue-sharing models must be implemented to ensure lower-income countries benefit from carbon credit sales.\n\n   Step 4: The context emphasizes the importance of corrective and distributive justice, suggesting that high-income countries should bear the burden of driving down technology costs and developing transferable frameworks. This could include technology transfer programs or subsidized access to CGS infrastructure for lower-income countries."

        "question": "What are the potential long-term distributive justice implications if high-income countries with historic oil and gas production continue to dominate CGS infrastructure development, and how might policy frameworks mitigate these disparities while still meeting global climate targets?",
        "answer": "The potential long-term distributive justice implications of high-income countries dominating CGS infrastructure development are significant. These countries, with their historic oil and gas production, already hold advantages in technical expertise, infrastructure, and financial resources, which could lead to a concentration of wealth and power in carbon markets, leaving lower-income countries further behind.\n\n   Step 1: The context notes that CGS projects are expected to generate high-value carbon credits due to the longevity and security of storage, with profits peaking around If high-income countries control this infrastructure, they could capture most of the financial benefits, exacerbating global inequalities.\n\n   Step 2: Policy frameworks must address these disparities by ensuring equitable access to CGS infrastructure and benefits. For example, international agreements could mandate shared ownership or profit-sharing models for CGS projects involving cross-border collaboration.\n\n   Step 3: The context suggests that high-income countries should take responsibility for driving down technology costs and developing frameworks that can be transferred to lower-income countries. This aligns with corrective justice principles, given their historical contributions to climate change.\n\n   Step 4: To meet global climate targets, policies must also incentivize CGS development in lower-income countries. This could include grants, low-interest loans, or preferential access to carbon markets for projects in these regions, ensuring they are not left out of the CGS economy."

        "question": "Given the limited inclusion of subsurface carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies like BECCS and DACCS in national climate strategies compared to nature-based solutions, what systemic barriers must be addressed to align policy commitments with the scale of CDR required in IPCC mitigation pathways?",
        "answer": "The limited inclusion of subsurface carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies like BECCS and DACCS in national climate strategies, compared to nature-based solutions, stems from several systemic barriers that must be addressed to align policy commitments with IPCC mitigation pathways.\n\n   Step 1: The context reveals that subsurface CDR technologies are less frequently mentioned in long-term low-emission development strategies (LT-LEDS) due to their higher costs and lower technological maturity compared to nature-based solutions like LULUCF. For example, only 20 countries plan for subsurface CDR, while 66 mention nature-based removals.\n\n   Step 2: Policy frameworks must prioritize funding and research to advance subsurface CDR technologies. This includes public and private investment in pilot projects and demonstrations to reduce costs and improve scalability, as seen with the limited current capacity of 6 MtCO2 per year for subsurface CDR.\n\n   Step 3: The context highlights a mismatch between the scale of CDR proposed in LT-LEDS and what is required globally. Policies must set clear targets for subsurface CDR deployment, ensuring it is not dependent on fossil CCS or existing oil and gas sectors, which disproportionately favor high-income countries.\n\n   Step 4: Systemic barriers such as lack of CO2 storage indicator (CSI) assessments in lower-income countries must be addressed. The context shows that only 39% of countries have a CSI, limiting their ability to plan for subsurface CDR. Expanding CSI assessments and providing technical support can help bridge this gap.\n\n   Step 5: Finally, harmonizing and standardizing LT-LEDS reporting can improve transparency and accountability, ensuring that subsurface CDR is adequately represented in national strategies and aligned with global climate goals."
