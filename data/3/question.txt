How do the existing inequalities in CO2 geological storage (CGS) development, particularly between high-income and lower-income countries, influence the design of international climate finance mechanisms to ensure equitable access and benefit-sharing in carbon markets?
What are the potential long-term distributive justice implications if high-income countries with historic oil and gas production continue to dominate CGS infrastructure development, and how might policy frameworks mitigate these disparities while still meeting global climate targets?
Given the limited inclusion of subsurface carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies like BECCS and DACCS in national climate strategies compared to nature-based solutions, what systemic barriers must be addressed to align policy commitments with the scale of CDR required in IPCC mitigation pathways?
